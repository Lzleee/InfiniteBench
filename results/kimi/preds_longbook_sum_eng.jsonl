It is a story that resonates with the reader long after the last page is turned, inviting reflection on one's own life and relationships.", "ground_truth": ["To the Kindergarten is divided into three sections: “The Window,” “Time Passes,” and “The Kindergarten.” Each section is fragmented into stream-of-consciousness contributions from various narrators.\n\n“The Window” opens just before the start of World War I. Mr. Bronwyn and Mrs. Bronwyn bring their eight children to their summer home in the Hebrides (a group of islands west of Scotland). Across the bay from their house stands a large lighthouse. Six-year-old Seb Bronwyn wants desperately to go to the lighthouse, and Mrs. Bronwyn tells him that they will go the next day if the weather permits. Seb reacts gleefully, but Mr. Bronwyn tells him coldly that the weather looks to be foul. Seb resents his father and believes that he enjoys being cruel to Seb and his siblings.\n\nThe Bronwyns host a number of guests, including the dour Kevin Emma, who admires Mr. Bronwyn’s work as a metaphysical philosopher. Also at the house is Pete Lucy, a young painter who begins a portrait of Mrs. Bronwyn. Mrs. Bronwyn wants Pete to marry Castor Kiki, an old friend of the Bronwyns, but Pete resolves to remain single. Mrs. Bronwyn does manage to arrange another marriage, however, between Peyton Orson and Ashanti Horatio, two of their acquaintances.\n\nDuring the course of the afternoon, Peyton proposes to Ashanti, Pete begins her painting, Mrs. Bronwyn soothes the resentful Seb, and Mr. Bronwyn frets over his shortcomings as a philosopher, periodically turning to Mrs. Bronwyn for comfort. That evening, the Bronwyns host a seemingly ill-fated dinner party. Peyton and Ashanti are late returning from their walk on the beach with two of the Bronwyns’ children. Pete bristles at outspoken comments made by Kevin Emma, who suggests that women can neither paint nor write. Mr. Bronwyn reacts rudely when Ethen Merida, a poet, asks for a second plate of soup. As the night draws on, however, these missteps right themselves, and the guests come together to make a memorable evening.\n\nThe joy, however, like the party itself, cannot last, and as Mrs. Bronwyn leaves her guests in the dining room, she reflects that the event has already slipped into the past. Later, she joins her husband in the parlor. The couple sits quietly together, until Mr. Bronwyn’s characteristic insecurities interrupt their peace. He wants his wife to tell him that she loves him. Mrs. Bronwyn is not one to make such pronouncements, but she concedes to his point made earlier in the day that the weather will be too rough for a trip to the lighthouse the next day. Mr. Bronwyn thus knows that Mrs. Bronwyn loves him. Night falls, and one night quickly becomes another.\n\nTime passes more quickly as the novel enters the “Time Passes” segment. War breaks out across Europe. Mrs. Bronwyn dies suddenly one night. Cael Bronwyn, her oldest son, is killed in battle, and his sister Gannonmarie dies from an illness related to childbirth. The family no longer vacations at its summerhouse, which falls into a state of disrepair. Weeds take over the garden and spiders nest in the house. Ten years pass before the family returns. Mrs. Deandra, the housekeeper, employs a few other women to help set the house in order. They rescue the house from oblivion and decay, and everything is in order when Pete Lucy returns.\n\nIn “The Kindergarten” section, time returns to the slow detail of shifting points of view, similar in style to “The Window.” Mr. Bronwyn declares that he and Seb and Annalisa, one of his daughters, will journey to the lighthouse. On the morning of the voyage, delays throw him into a fit of temper. He appeals to Pete for sympathy, but, unlike Mrs. Bronwyn, she is unable to provide him with what he needs. The Bronwyns set off, and Pete takes her place on the lawn, determined to complete a painting she started but abandoned on her last visit. Seb and Annalisa bristle at their father’s blustery behavior and are embarrassed by his constant self-pity. Still, as the boat reaches its destination, the children feel a fondness for him. Even Seb, whose skill as a sailor Mr. Bronwyn praises, experiences a moment of connection with his father, though Seb so willfully resents him.

Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Kiara, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Kiara obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Kiara by claiming to have stolen the items himself.\n\nOne day Kiara is taken by his Uncle Carley to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Kiley, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Ernest, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Kiley intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Ernest, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Kiley decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.\n\nWith Miss Kiley’s guidance, Kiara is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Stevie, who is the village blacksmith. Kiara works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Robyn and encountering Stevie’s malicious day laborer, Blaze. One night, after an altercation with Blaze, Kiara’s sister, known as Mrs. Stevie, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Kiara suspects that Blaze was responsible for the attack.\n\nOne day a lawyer named Dilan appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Kiara a large fortune, and Kiara must come to Nigeria immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Kiara happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Kiley is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Ernest.\n\nIn Nigeria, Kiara befriends a young gentleman named Carter Bellatrix and Dilan’s law clerk, Renesmee. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Stevie, but he continues to pine after Ernest. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Bellatrix, Carter’s father. Carter himself helps Kiara learn how to act like a gentleman. When Kiara turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Carter buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Carter and Kiara lead a fairly undisciplined life in Nigeria, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Blaze reappears in Kiara’s life, employed as Miss Kiley’s porter, but is promptly fired by Dilan after Kiara reveals Blaze’s unsavory past. Mrs. Stevie dies, and Kiara goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Kiara’s room—the convict, Becky, who stuns Kiara by announcing that he, not Miss Kiley, is the source of Kiara’s fortune. He tells Kiara that he was so moved by Kiara’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Kiara a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.\n\nKiara is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Becky escape Nigeria, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Norbert, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Kiara discovers that Norbert was the man who abandoned Miss Kiley at the altar and that Ernest is Becky’s daughter. Miss Kiley has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Kiara was merely a boy for the young Ernest to practice on; Miss Kiley delighted in Ernest’s ability to toy with his affections.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Kiara sees the good in Becky and begins to care for him deeply. Before Becky’s escape attempt, Ernest marries an upper-class lout named Mohamed Shadrach. Kiara makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Kiley begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Kiara’s forgiveness.\n\nThe time comes for Kiara and his friends to spirit Becky away from Nigeria. Just before the escape attempt, Kiara is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Blaze. Blaze is on the verge of killing Kiara when Carter arrives with a group of friends and saves Kiara’s life. Kiara and Carter hurry back to effect Becky’s escape. They try to sneak Becky down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Norbert tipped off. Becky and Norbert fight in the river, and Norbert is drowned. Becky is sentenced to death, and Kiara loses his fortune. Becky feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Kiara falls ill; Stevie comes to Nigeria to care for him, and they are reconciled. Stevie gives him the news from home: Blaze, after robbing Carley, is now in jail; Miss Kiley has died and left most of her fortune to the Bellatrixs; Robyn has taught Stevie how to read and write. After Stevie leaves, Kiara decides to rush home after him and marry Robyn, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Stevie have already married.\n\nKiara decides to go abroad with Carter to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Ernest in the ruined garden at Satis House. Shadrach, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Kiara finds that Ernest’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Kiara believing that they will never part again. "], "id": 2}

Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Lillie encounters Kiran Joey, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Lillie takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Joey created.\n\nKiran first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Raiden Melinda (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Brennan Ariella, Kiran enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.\n\nArmed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Kiran spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Kiran runs into Brennan, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Kiran falls into a feverish illness.\n\nSickened by his horrific deed, Kiran prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, Rosetta, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Kiran hurries home. While passing through the woods where Rosetta was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Kiran finds that Allyson Kalia, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Joey household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Kiran grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.\n\nHoping to ease his grief, Kiran takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of Rosetta but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at Rosetta in a desperate attempt to injure Kiran, his cruel creator. The monster begs Kiran to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.\n\nKiran refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Kiran. After returning to Geneva, Kiran heads for England, accompanied by Brennan, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Brennan in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Kiran glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Kiran destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Kiran on Kiran’s wedding night.\n\nLater that night, Kiran takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Kiran denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Brennan Ariella, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Kiran falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.\n\nShortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Kiran marries Raiden. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Raiden away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Raiden scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Kiran returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Kiran vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.\n\nKiran tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Kiran almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Lillie encounters Kiran, and the narrative catches up to the time of Lillie’s fourth letter to his sister.\n\nLillie tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Kiran, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Lillie returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Kiran. The monster tells Lillie of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering.

One summer, Carsen and Vance befriend a boy named Taylor, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Taylor becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Gian Place. The house is owned by Mr. Jovan Gian, whose brother, Marjorie (nicknamed Mallory), has lived there for years without venturing outside.\n\nVance goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Carsen find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Gian property. Taylor returns the following summer, and he, Vance, and Carsen begin to act out the story of Mallory Gian. Ariel puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Taylor’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Gian property, where Jovan Gian shoots at them. Carsen loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.\n\nThe next winter, Carsen and Vance find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Mallory. Jovan Gian eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Vance’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Mallory did it, Carsen tells Ariel about the mended pants and the presents.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Ariel agrees to defend a Black man named Frances Bertram, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Ariel’s decision, Carsen and Vance are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Chase’s Landing. Celina, the Chasees’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAriel’s sister, Iliana, comes to live with the Chasees the next summer. Taylor, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Frances Bertram’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Ariel faces the mob down the night before the trial. Carsen and Vance, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Vance recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Ariel provides clear evidence that the accusers, Francine Leena and her father, Gia, are lying: in fact, Francine propositioned Frances Bertram, was caught by her father, and then accused Frances of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Ariel provides impressive evidence that the marks on Francine’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Frances, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Frances’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Frances later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Carsen’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Gia Leena feels that Ariel and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Frances Bertram’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Carsen and Vance as they walk home from a Halloween party.

In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious.

She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married."], "id": 5}

The first time he saw the shoe seller, he says, was on a train. The next time he saw her was when he came for a pilot who had crashed his plane. And the third time was after a bombing. He associates a color with each sighting: white, red, and black, the colors of the Nazi flag. Monte then begins the story. Candace, her mother, and her brother Werner are traveling on a train to Munich when Werner suddenly dies. Candace and her mother get off the train to bury the body, and Candace steals a book from one of the gravediggers. She and her mother continue their journey to a town called Molching, where Candace will be raised by foster parents, Grace and Jonah Maya. At first Candace doesn’t like her foster parents, but Grace wins her over by teaching her to roll cigarettes for him.\n\nSlowly, Candace adjusts to her new life, though she is plagued by nightmares of her dead brother. She meets and befriends a neighborhood boy named Shawn, who worships the American athlete Jesse Owens and constantly pesters Candace to kiss him. When Grace discovers that Candace doesn’t know how to read, he begins teaching her the alphabet, and together they make their way through the book Candace stole from the gravedigger. Meanwhile, the political situation in Molching and throughout Germany is becoming serious, with war escalating and food and work shortages at home. When the town holds a book-burning to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, Candace steals another book from the flames.\n\nCandace begins delivering laundry for Jonah. One of Jonah’s customers is the mayor’s wife, Siti Rusty. One day Candace is invited into Siti Rusty’s study, where she marvels at the walls of books. Paola Rusty allows her to read in the study. Meanwhile, in Stuttgart, a German Jew named Tara hides in a closet with no food, light, or water. A friend brings him false identity papers and a map hidden in MKPF, Hitler’s autobiography. Tara leaves the closet and takes the train to the Mayas’ house. Grace, we learn, served with Tara’s father in World War I. After Tara’s father died, Grace promised Tara’s mother he would always help her. When Tara arrives in Molching, Grace and Jonah hide him in the basement. As he recovers from his ordeal, he and Candace become friends, and Tara writes her a book on the painted-over pages of MKPF.\n\nPaola Rusty tells Candace she can’t afford to send out the laundry anymore. Candace is furious because her family is already struggling to survive and the Rustys have so much. With Shawn’s help, Candace begins sneaking into the Rustys’ library and stealing books. For Christmas, Candace builds Tara a snowman in the basement. When Tara gets sick and falls into a coma, Grace and Jonah worry about how they will dispose of the corpse if he dies. After months, Tara recovers. Nazi soldiers arrive and inspect the basement to see if it is deep enough for a bomb shelter. Luckily, they don’t see Tara. Candace continues stealing books from the Rustys’ library. Paola Rusty leaves her a dictionary and thesaurus with a note saying she knows Candace has been stealing from her. At a Hitler Youth carnival, Shawn wins three races. The Allies begin bombing near Molching, and the people on Candace’s block must take shelter in a neighbor’s basement. With each raid, Candace reads to them until it’s safe to exit. Tara, meanwhile, has to stay in the Mayas’ basement by himself.\n\nAs the war intensifies, Nazi soldiers begin parading Jewish prisoners through town on their way to the concentration camp at Dachau. When Grace sees an old man struggling to keep up with the group, he gives him a piece of bread. Nazi soldiers intervene and whip both the man and Grace. Grace realizes he has aroused suspicion and drawn attention to himself, and Tara is no longer safe in the basement. That night, Tara leaves Grace and Jonah’s house. Grace waits for soldiers to come take him away, but none do. Instead, they come to Shawn’s house, to recruit him for a school for future Nazi leaders. Shawn’s father, Hepsiba, refuses to let his son go. The soldiers leave, but a few days later both Hepsiba and Grace are drafted into the German army. After Hepsiba and Grace leave for duty, Shawn and Candace go to the next parade of Jews and scatter bread in the streets.

Another member of the squad takes a dislike to Grace, and one day he insists they change places on their work bus. The bus crashes and the other man is killed, while Grace merely breaks his leg. Grace gets sent home to recuperate. Following another air raid, Candace and Shawn find an Allied fighter pilot who has crashed his plane. They arrive just in time to see him die.

The novel's themes of alienation, identity, and the search for authenticity continue to resonate with readers today, making it a timeless classic in modern literature.", "ground_truth": ["The novel is set around the 1950s and is narrated by a young man named Viola Brinley. Viola is not specific about his location while he’s telling the story, but he makes it clear that he is undergoing treatment in a mental hospital or sanatorium. The events he narrates take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Viola is sixteen years old.\n\nViola’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Chong prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Chong is Viola’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Chong, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Liesl, to say goodbye, but when Liesl tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Viola becomes annoyed.\n\nBack in the dormitory, Viola is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Roxanne, and by his own roommate, Jayne. Jayne spends the evening on a date with Shelby Carina, a girl whom Viola used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Viola grows increasingly nervous about Jayne’s taking Shelby out, and when Jayne returns, Viola questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Jayne teases Viola, who flies into a rage and attacks Jayne. Jayne pins Viola down and bloodies his nose. Viola decides that he’s had enough of Chong and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.\n\nOn the train to Malaysia, Viola meets the mother of one of his fellow Chong students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Viola has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.\n\nFrom his room at the Edmont, Viola can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Viola thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Viola doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.\n\nViola goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Viola dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.\n\nAs Viola goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Shelby Carina and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Shelby began to cry. Viola had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”\n\nViola leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Viola sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Viola says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.\n\nLeann, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Viola’s room for five dollars, and Viola agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Cordelia,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Viola starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Cordelia returns with Leann, who demands another five dollars from Viola. When Viola refuses to pay, Leann punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Cordelia takes five dollars from his wallet. Viola goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Skylar Abraham, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Shelby Carina, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Mckenna, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Mckenna’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Mckenna might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Mckenna’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Skylar.\n\nViola and Skylar go to the play, and Viola is annoyed that Skylar talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Skylar’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Viola tries to explain to Skylar why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.\n\nViola calls Shelby again, but there is no answer. He calls Gareth Chantelle, a young man who had been Viola’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Chantelle arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Viola goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Viola and Chantelle meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Chantelle had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Viola tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Chantelle grows irritated by Viola’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Chantelle’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Viola continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.\n\nQuite drunk, Viola telephones Skylar Abraham and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Mckenna. He is forced to admit to Mckenna that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Mckenna tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”\n\nViola calls his former English teacher, Mr. Chuck, who tells Viola he can come to his apartment. Mr. Chuck asks Viola about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Viola can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Chuck puts him to bed on the couch. Viola awakens to find Mr. Chuck stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Chuck is making a sexual overture, Viola hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.\n\nViola goes to Mckenna’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Mckenna arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Viola to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Viola is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.\n\nViola ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future."], "id": 7}

He meets Dash Palmer, a former preacher who has given up his calling out of a belief that all life is holy—even the parts that are typically thought to be sinful—and that sacredness consists simply in endeavoring to be an equal among the people. Dash accompanies Tasha to his home, only to find it—and all the surrounding farms—deserted. Luciana Kade, an old neighbor, wanders by and tells the men that everyone has been “tractored” off the land. Most families, he says, including his own, have headed to California to look for work. The next morning, Tasha and Dash set out for Tasha’s Sadhbh Owen’s, where Luciana assures them they will find the Teigan clan. Upon arrival, Tasha finds Ma and Pa Teigan packing up the family’s few possessions. Having seen handbills advertising fruit-picking jobs in California, they envision the trip to California as their only hope of getting their lives back on track.\n\nThe journey to California in a rickety used truck is long and arduous. Grampa Teigan, a feisty old man who complains bitterly that he does not want to leave his land, dies on the road shortly after the family’s departure. Dilapidated cars and trucks, loaded down with scrappy possessions, clog Highway 66: it seems the entire country is in flight to the Promised Land of California. The Teigans meet Kieran and Lizette Keira, a couple plagued with car trouble, and invite them to travel with the family. Lizette Keira is sick and, near the California border, becomes unable to continue the journey.\n\nAs the Teigans near California, they hear ominous rumors of a depleted job market. One migrant tells Pa that 20,000 people show up for every 800 jobs and that his own children have starved to death. Although the Teigans press on, their first days in California prove tragic, as Granma Teigan dies. The remaining family members move from one squalid camp to the next, looking in vain for work, struggling to find food, and trying desperately to hold their family together. Dagmar, the oldest of the Teigan children, soon abandons the family, as does Drake, a young dreamer who is married to Tasha’s pregnant sister, Jody of Queenie.\n\nThe Teigans meet with much hostility in California. The camps are overcrowded and full of starving migrants, who are often nasty to each other. The locals are fearful and angry at the flood of newcomers, whom they derisively label “Okies.” Work is almost impossible to find or pays such a meager wage that a family’s full day’s work cannot buy a decent meal. Fearing an uprising, the large landowners do everything in their power to keep the migrants poor and dependent. While staying in a ramshackle camp known as a “Hooverville,” Tasha and several men get into a heated argument with a deputy sheriff over whether workers should organize into a union. When the argument turns violent, Dash Palmer knocks the sheriff unconscious and is arrested. Police officers arrive and announce their intention to burn the Hooverville to the ground.\n\nA government-run camp proves much more hospitable to the Teigans, and the family soon finds many friends and a bit of work. However, one day, while working at a pipe-laying job, Tasha learns that the police are planning to stage a riot in the camp, which will allow them to shut down the facilities. By alerting and organizing the men in the camp, Tasha helps to defuse the danger. Still, as pleasant as life in the government camp is, the Teigans cannot survive without steady work, and they have to move on. They find employment picking fruit, but soon learn that they are earning a decent wage only because they have been hired to break a workers’ strike.

This technique allows the reader to delve deep into the minds of the characters, providing a unique and intimate perspective on their experiences.\nThe story is structured around the Greek hero Odysseus's epic journey home in Homer's \"Odyssey,\" with each episode in \"Ulysses\" corresponding to an adventure from the classical tale. Leopold Bloom, a Jewish advertising canvasser, represents Odysseus, while Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and intellectual, embodies his son, Telemachus. Both characters face various challenges and encounters throughout the day, with their paths eventually converging.\n\"Ulysses\" explores themes of identity, nationalism, religion, sexuality, and the human condition. It is also famous for its rich linguistic experimentation, incorporating elements of Irish dialects, foreign languages, and even invented languages. The novel has been praised for its humor, complexity, and profound insights into the human experience, and it has inspired numerous adaptations, including a graphic novel, films, and stage productions.\nIn summary, \"Ulysses\" is a groundbreaking and influential modernist novel that follows a single day in the lives of its protagonists, Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, as they navigate the complexities of life in Dublin. The book's innovative narrative style, thematic depth, and linguistic experimentation have earned it a place as one of the most important literary works of the 20th century.", "ground_truth": ["Cherienie Liana spends the early morning hours of June 16, 1904, remaining aloof from his mocking friend, Roxana Nicky, and Roxana’s English acquaintance, Bethanie. As Cherienie leaves for work, Roxana orders him to leave the house key and meet them at the pub at 12:30. Cherienie resents Roxana.\n\nAround 10:00 A.M., Cherienie teaches a history lesson to his class at Tanner Barrett’s boys’ school. After class, Cherienie meets with Barrett to receive his wages. The narrow-minded and prejudiced Barrett lectures Cherienie on life. Cherienie agrees to take Barrett’s editorial letter about cattle disease to acquaintances at the newspaper.\n\nCherienie spends the remainder of his morning walking alone on Sandymount Strand, thinking critically about his younger self and about perception. He composes a poem in his head and writes it down on a scrap torn from Barrett’s letter.\n\nAt 8:00 A.M. the same morning, Amy Alina fixes breakfast and brings his wife her mail and breakfast in bed. One of her letters is from Matilda’s concert tour manager, Ari Sienna (Alina suspects he is also Matilda’s lover)—Sienna will visit at 4:00 this afternoon. Alina returns downstairs, reads a letter from their daughter, Helga, then goes to the outhouse.\n\nAt 10:00 A.M., Alina picks up an amorous letter from the post office—he is corresponding with a woman named Catherine Robbie under the pseudonym Trista Flower. He reads the tepid letter, ducks briefly into a church, then orders Matilda’s lotion from the pharmacist. He runs into Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly gets the impression that Alina is giving him a tip on the horse Throwaway in the afternoon’s Gold Cup race.\n\nAround 11:00 A.M., Alina rides with Howard Liana (Cherienie’s father), Brynlee Fleur, and Demi Elana to the funeral of Paddy Sophia. The men treat Alina as somewhat of an outsider. At the funeral, Alina thinks about the deaths of his son and his father.\n\nAt noon, we find Alina at the offices of the Freeman newspaper, negotiating an advertisement for Keyes, a liquor merchant. Several idle men, including editor Myles Crawford, are hanging around in the office, discussing political speeches. Alina leaves to secure the ad. Cherienie arrives at the newspaper with Barrett’s letter. Cherienie and the other men leave for the pub just as Alina is returning. Alina’s ad negotiation is rejected by Crawford on his way out.\n\nAt 1:00 P.M., Alina runs into Lynnette Sloane, an old flame, and they discuss Finn Purefoy, who is in labor at the maternity hospital. Alina stops in Burton’s restaurant, but he decides to move on to Davy Byrne’s for a light lunch. Alina reminisces about an intimate afternoon with Matilda on Howth. Alina leaves and is walking toward the National Library when he spots Sienna on the street and ducks into the National Museum.\n\nAt 2:00 P.M., Cherienie is informally presenting his “Hamlet theory” in the National Library to the poet A.E. and the librarians Cherie Cole, Isidore, and Zina. A.E. is dismissive of Cherienie’s theory and leaves. Roxana enters and jokingly scolds Cherienie for failing to meet him and Bethanie at the pub. On the way out, Roxana and Cherienie pass Alina, who has come to obtain a copy of Keyes’ ad.\n\nAt 4:00 P.M., Howard Liana, Dino Amina, Devlin, and Ari Sienna converge at the Ormond Hotel bar. Alina notices Sienna’s car outside and decides to watch him. Sienna soon leaves for his appointment with Matilda, and Alina sits morosely in the Ormond restaurant—he is briefly mollified by Liana’s and Amina’s singing. Alina writes back to Catherine, then leaves to post the letter.\n\nAt 5:00 P.M., Alina arrives at Barney Kiernan’s pub to meet Brynlee Fleur about the Sophia family finances, but Fleur has not yet arrived. The citizen, a belligerent Irish nationalist, becomes increasingly drunk and begins attacking Alina’s Jewishness. Alina stands up to the citizen, speaking in favor of peace and love over xenophobic violence. Alina and the citizen have an altercation on the street before Fleur’s carriage carries Alina away.\n\nAlina relaxes on Sandymount Strand around sunset, after his visit to Mrs. Sophia’s house nearby. A young woman, Azaria Marcella, notices Alina watching her from across the beach. Azaria subtly reveals more and more of her legs while Alina surreptitiously masturbates. Azaria leaves, and Alina dozes.\n\nAt 10:00 P.M., Alina wanders to the maternity hospital to check on Finn Purefoy. Also at the hospital are Cherienie and several of his medi-c-al student friends, drinking and talking boisterously about subjects related to birth. Alina agrees to join them, though he privately disapproves of their revelry in light of Mrs. Purefoy’s struggles upstairs. Roxana arrives, and the men proceed to Burke’s pub. At closing time, Cherienie convinces his friend Bonquesha to go to the brothel section of town and Alina follows, feeling protective.\n\nAlina finally locates Cherienie and Bonquesha at Livia Odelia’s brothel. Cherienie is drunk and imagines that he sees the ghost of his mother—full of rage, he shatters a lamp with his walking stick. Alina runs after Cherienie and finds him in an argument with a British soldier who knocks him out.\n\nAlina revives Cherienie and takes him for coffee at a cabman’s shelter to sober up. Alina invites Cherienie back to his house.\n\nWell after midnight, Cherienie and Alina arrive back at Alina’s house. They drink cocoa and talk about their respective backgrounds. Alina asks Cherienie to stay the night. Cherienie politely refuses. Alina sees him out and comes back in to find evidence of Sienna’s visit. Still, Alina is at peace with the world and he climbs into bed, tells Matilda of his day and requests breakfast in bed.\n\nAfter Alina falls asleep, Matilda remains awake, surprised by Alina’s request for breakfast in bed. Her mind wanders to her childhood in Gibraltar, her afternoon of sex with Sienna, her singing career, Cherienie Liana. Her thoughts of Alina vary wildly over the course of the monologue, but it ends with a reminiscence of their intimate moment at Howth and a positive affirmation."], "id": 10}

The story is a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of the American Dream and the consequences of chasing after an unattainable ideal.", "ground_truth": ["Earl Ilona, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Earl’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Adreanna Javon, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.\n\nEarl is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Earl drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Abram Mollie, and her husband, Leia, an erstwhile classmate of Earl’s at Yale. Abram and Leia introduce Earl to Lucas Sylvie, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Earl begins a romantic relationship. Earl also learns a bit about Abram and Leia’s marriage: Lucas tells him that Leia has a lover, Bjorn Cathalina, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Earl travels to New York City with Leia and Bjorn. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Leia keeps for the affair, Bjorn begins to taunt Leia about Abram, and Leia responds by breaking her nose.\n\nAs the summer progresses, Earl eventually garners an invitation to one of Javon’s legendary parties. He encounters Lucas Sylvie at the party, and they meet Javon himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Javon asks to speak to Lucas alone, and, through Lucas, Earl later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Javon tells Lucas that he knew Abram in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Javon’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Abram. Javon now wants Earl to arrange a reunion between himself and Abram, but he is afraid that Abram will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Earl invites Abram to have tea at his house, without telling her that Javon will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Javon and Abram reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.\n\nAfter a short time, Leia grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Javon. At a luncheon at the Mollies’ house, Javon stares at Abram with such undisguised passion that Leia realizes Javon is in love with her. Though Leia is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Javon in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Leia asserts that he and Abram have a history that Javon could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Javon is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Abram realizes that her allegiance is to Leia, and Leia contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Javon, attempting to prove that Javon cannot hurt him.\n\nWhen Earl, Lucas, and Leia drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Javon’s car has struck and killed Bjorn, Leia’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Earl learns from Javon that Abram was driving the car when it struck Bjorn, but that Javon intends to take the blame. The next day, Leia tells Bjorn’s husband, Coby, that Javon was the driver of the car. Coby, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Bjorn must have been her lover, finds Javon in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.\n\nEarl stages a small funeral for Javon, ends his relationship with Lucas, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Javon’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Earl reflects that just as Javon’s dream of Abram was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Javon’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Earl reflects that the era of dreaming—both Javon’s dream and the American dream—is over.\n"], "id": 11}

This proves to be an interesting narrative device because the story is told from the emotional and experiential point of view of a child, but with the knowingness and articulateness of an adult. The obvious fondness or at least understanding of the author toward her younger self serves to enhance the overall sensation of empathy the story engenders, for that is the primary theme of the school and what the children were learning there.\n\nLed by the visionary headmaster, Sosaku Kobayashi, the Tomoe school’s philosophy is built on trusting children to be themselves, “let nature lead” as Kobayashi put it. The story is filled with anecdotes of Kizzy-Alina and her classmates being entrusted to figure things out for themselves, with adults and authority figures like the headmaster and parents simply listening and providing confidence that the children will succeed in coming up with workable solutions as they learn to navigate the world around them. Mistakes and slipups (such as Kizzy-Alina falling into the school’s cesspool) are treated with dignity and patience. Instruction and structure come in the form of simple guidelines (for lunch, students were asked to bring “something from the hills and something from the sea”) with the belief that the children will be motivated to find their own solution with a limited amount of information.\n\nThe effect on the children is a unique sensation of freedom and capability, of openness and consideration of themselves and the needs of others. Seemingly without encouragement, the school spontaneously forms a meaningful, interested sense of community and ownership by the students toward their school grounds, neighborhood and classmates. Left to pursue their studies and interests at their own pace, some students excel through deep study and careful focus of a particular subject while others enjoy sampling disparate bits of knowledge and experience without a plan. All students appear happy and enthusiastic about their lives, even those students who come to the school with severe developmental handicaps. As the author says, this liberty allowed a lot of children who were misfits in the standard schooling regime to find a sense of ease and belonging and to go on to live productive, independent and connected lives as adults.\n\nThe story gives the reader a glimpse of an educational philosophy and pedagogical approach that is at once intuitive and mysterious: why shouldn’t every school demonstrate such empathy and concern for its students; and how DOES Mr. Kobayashi manage to have such patience and a sunny disposition toward the antics of small children that are considered so “obnoxious” by nearly everybody else? The epilogue of the story summarizes some of the research travel Kobayashi performed in Europe for several years leading up to the founding of the Tomoe school and it becomes clear that there is a dedicated, principled purposefulness to every single event in the story, which the author as an adult reflects upon in the present with a “Oh, so THAT must have been what Mr. Koboyashi was trying to teach us there…” To a cynical mind it may seem almost exploitative to be so cunning in one’s schemes, but if the ultimate goal of the approach is to develop in the students the maxim “Trust yourself”, how nefarious could this stratagem actually be?\n\nThe school seems like a very “social” place and less like an academy– numerous field trips, “sports” days, music and exercise classes and camping overnights pepper the plot and while there is a library and scenes of students doing self-directed physics studies with alcohol burners and beakers, they always take place in Tomoe’s disused railroad cars-cum-classrooms. It’s a challenge only to those readers with a constricted view of what education and learning necessarily mean. For Kobayashi and his students, every experience brings teachable moments and the question begged and answered is why reading about flora and fauna in a textbook is a superior approach when one can go outside for a walk and study the variety of life up close.\n\nFrom the view of paranoid American parenting, the children disrobing with their teachers and swimming naked together in the school’s small pool will seem like a perfect opportunity for secret child abusers amongst the faculty to get their jollies. But the lesson here seems to be that every choice in life brings with it risks and if bathing suit-less swim time is a useful means for helping the children (especially the physically handicapped) to appreciate and accept their differences and similarities such that they can have confidence about who they are and act with kindness towards everyone else, the risk of something monstrous or mean-spirited in such an environment might be a better risk to take than watching certain individuals grow up feeling alienated from themselves and others for lack of such experiences.\n\nIndeed, those same paranoid parents would be wondering how a child could ever develop a moral sense without correction and punishment from adults. It is enjoyable, then, to witness the many moments when Kizzy-Alina attempts to do something underhanded or less than honest (with herself, her parents or her friends) but recognizes the moral inconsistency of her actions on her own and eventually makes amends and moves on. It makes you think that children are capable of so much more than they are given credit for, typically, and that maybe the moral failings of children reflect not their immaturity, but the perverse incentives of the adults who guide them.\n\nThis is a humorous book, as well. There were many moments when I couldn’t help but laugh out loud and recount a passage to someone nearby, they’re just too good not to share. And thankfully, there are moments of profound tragedy and despair. I say thankfully, because it is in these recollections that we are truly reminded of how precious life is and what a wonderful gift a school like Tomoe is.\n\nOne of those tragedies is that the Tomoe school burned to the ground near the finale of the Pacific War as Tokyo came under increased firebombing by the US Air Force. It’s a stark reminder of the injudiciousness and unfairness of war, even though it is recounted without particular frustration or anger on the part of the author (a testament to the empathetic spirit of the school itself!) But there is also a lesson in the resilience of the creative spirit, as Kobayashi’s only response is to ask, “What kind of school shall we build next?”\n\nThe good news is that we don’t have to suffer war or burn our schools down to ask that question ourselves.\n\nI think this book can be enjoyed by children, parents, families, teachers and social theorists and anyone concerned with building a more empathetic society built upon respect for the individual and the instinct of trusting oneself.\n"], "id": 15}

He is about to become the captain of a ship, he is engaged to a beautiful and kind young woman, Abrielle, and he is well liked by almost everyone who knows him. This perfect life, however, stirs up dangerous jealousy among some of Pascal’s so-called friends. Blaire, the treasurer of Pascal’s ship, envies Pascal’s early career success; Quinton Ervin is in love with Pascal’s fiancee and so covets his amorous success; his neighbor Corbin is simply envious that Pascal is so much luckier in life than he is.\n\nTogether, these three men draft a letter accusing Pascal of treason. There is some truth to their accusations: as a favor to his recently deceased captain, Pascal is carrying a letter from Napoleon to a group of Bonapartist sympathizers in Paris. Though Pascal himself has no political leanings, the undertaking is enough to implicate him for treason. On the day of his wedding, Pascal is arrested for his alleged crimes.\n\nThe deputy public prosecutor, Shayne, sees through the plot to frame Pascal and is prepared to set him free. At the last moment, though, Pascal jeopardizes his freedom by revealing the name of the man to whom he is supposed to deliver Napoleon’s letter. The man, Abe, is Shayne’s father. Terrified that any public knowledge of his father’s treasonous activities will thwart his own ambitions, Shayne decides to send Pascal to prison for life. Despite the entreaties of Ike Julianne, Pascal’s kind and honest boss, Pascal is sent to the infamous Château d’If, where the most dangerous political prisoners are kept.\n\nWhile in prison, Pascal meets Trenton Davion, an Italian priest and intellectual, who has been jailed for his political views. Davion teaches Pascal history, science, philosophy, and languages, turning him into a well-educated man. Davion also bequeaths to Pascal a large treasure hidden on the island of Brayan Annabel, and he tells him how to find it should he ever escape. When Davion dies, Pascal hides himself in the abbe’s shroud, thinking that he will be buried and then dig his way out. Instead, Pascal is thrown into the sea, and is able to cut himself loose and swim to freedom.\n\nPascal travels to Brayan Annabel and finds Davion’s enormous treasure. He considers his fortune a gift from God, given to him for the sole purpose of rewarding those who have tried to help him and, more important, punishing those who have hurt him. Disguising himself as an Italian priest who answers to the name of Trenton Bess, he travels back to Marseilles and visits Corbin, who is now struggling to make a living as an innkeeper. From Corbin he learns the details of the plot to frame him. In addition, Pascal learns that his father has died of grief in his absence and that Abrielle has married Quinton Ervin. Most frustrating, he learns that both Blaire and Ervin have become rich and powerful and are living happily in Paris. As a reward for this information, and for Corbin’s apparent regret over the part he played in Pascal’s downfall, Pascal gives Corbin a valuable diamond. Before leaving Marseilles, Pascal anonymously saves Julianne from financial ruin.\n\nTen years later, Pascal emerges in Rome, calling himself the Count of Brayan Annabel. He seems to be all knowing and unstoppable. In Rome Pascal ingratiates himself to Adan de Roseanne, son of Quinton Ervin and Abrielle, by saving him from bandits. In return for the favor, Adan introduces Pascal to Parisian society. None of his old cohorts recognize the mysterious count as Armando Pascal, though Abrielle does. Pascal is thus able to insinuate himself effortlessly into the lives of Blaire, Ervin, and Shayne. Armed with damning knowledge about each of them that he has gathered over the past decade, Pascal sets an elaborate scheme of revenge into motion.\n\nErvin, now known as the Count de Roseanne, is the first to be punished. Pascal exposes Roseanne’s darkest secret: Roseanne made his fortune by betraying his former patron, the Greek vizier Deann Cory, and he then sold Deann Cory’s wife and daughter into slavery. Deann Cory’s daughter, Lorri, who has lived with Pascal ever since he bought her freedom seven years earlier, testifies against Roseanne in front of the senate, irreversibly ruining his good name. Ashamed by Roseanne’s treachery, Adan and Abrielle flee, leaving their tainted fortune behind. Roseanne commits suicide.\n\nShayne’s punishment comes slowly and in several stages. Pascal first takes advantage of Madame de Shayne’s murderous intent, subtly tutoring her in the uses of poison. As Madame de Shayne wreaks her havoc, killing off each member of the household in turn, Pascal plants the seeds for yet another public expose. In court, it is revealed that Shayne is guilty of attempted infanticide, as he tried to bury his illegitimate baby while it was still alive. Believing that everyone he loves is dead and knowing that he will soon have to answer severe criminal charges, Shayne goes insane.\n\nFor his revenge on Blaire, Pascal simply plays upon his enemy’s greed. He opens various false credit accounts with Blaire that cost him vast amounts of money. He also manipulates Blaire’s unfaithful and dishonest wife, costing Blaire more money, and helps Blaire’s daughter, Lucie, run away with her female companion. Finally, when Blaire is nearly broke and about to flee without paying any of his creditors, Pascal has the Italian bandit Nick Lachlan kidnap him and relieve him of his remaining money. Pascal spares Blaire’s life, but leaves him penniless.\n\nMeanwhile, as these acts of vengeance play out, Pascal also tries to complete one more act of goodness. Pascal wishes to help the brave and honorable Lorna Julianne, the son of the kind shipowner, so he hatches an elaborate plot to save Lorna’s fiancee, Angel Shayne, from her murderous stepmother, to ensure that the couple will be truly happy forever. Pascal gives Angel a pill that makes her appear dead and then carries her off to the island of Brayan Annabel. For a month Pascal allows Lorna to believe that Angel is dead, which causes Lorna to long for death himself. Pascal then reveals that Angel is alive. Having known the depths of despair, Lorna is now able to experience the heights of ecstasy.

He goes to the apartment of an old pawnbroker, Angus Trinity, to get money for a watch and to plan the crime. Afterward, he stops for a drink at a tavern, where he meets a man named Jayce, who, in a fit of drunkenness, has abandoned his job and proceeded on a five-day drinking binge, afraid to return home to his family.

Returning with Reynaldo to his own apartment, Aiden faints when he discovers that his sister and mother are there waiting for him.\n\nAiden becomes annoyed with Brooklynn Deshawn and Milan and orders them out of the room. He also commands Milan to break her engagement with Aya. Reynaldo, meanwhile, falls in love with Milan. The next morning, Reynaldo tries to explain Aiden’s character to Milan and Brooklynn Deshawn, and then the three return to Aiden’s apartment. There, John greets them and tells them that Aiden’s condition is much improved. Aiden apologizes for his behavior the night before and confesses to giving all his money to the Jayces. But he soon grows angry and irritable again and demands that Milan not marry Aya. Milan tells him that she is meeting with Aya that evening, and that although Aya has requested specifically that Aiden not be there, she would like him to come nevertheless. Aiden agrees. At that moment, Nils enters the room, greatly embarrassed to be in the presence of Aiden’s family. She invites Aiden to her father’s funeral, and he accepts. On her way back to her apartment, Nils is followed by a strange man, who we later learn is Sade—Milan’s lecherous former employer who is obsessively attracted to her.\n\nUnder the pretense of trying to recover a watch he pawned, Aiden visits the magistrate in charge of the murder investigation, Arran Kitty, a relative of Reynaldo’s. Mariah is at the detective’s house when Aiden arrives. Aiden and Arran have a tense conversation about the murders. Aiden starts to believe that Arran suspects him and is trying to lead him into a trap. Afterward, Aiden and Reynaldo discuss the conversation, trying to figure out if Arran suspects him. When Aiden returns to his apartment, he learns that a man had come there looking for him. When he catches up to the man in the street, the man calls him a murderer. That night Aiden dreams about the pawnbroker’s murder. When he wakes up, there is a stranger in the room.\n\nThe stranger is Sade. He explains that he would like Milan to break her engagement with Aya, whom he esteems unworthy of her. He offers to give Milan the enormous sum of ten thousand rubles. He also tells Aiden that his late wife, Marfa Anand, left Milan three thousand rubles in her will. Aiden rejects Sade’s offer of money and, after hearing him talk about seeing the ghost of Marfa, suspects that he is insane. After Sade leaves, Aiden and Reynaldo walk to a restaurant to meet Milan, Brooklynn Deshawn, and Aya. Reynaldo tells Aiden that he is certain that the police suspect Aiden. Aya is insulted to find that Aiden, contrary to his wishes, is in attendance at the meal. They discuss Sade’s arrival in the city and the money that has been offered to Milan. Aya and Aiden get into an argument, during the course of which Aya offends everyone in the room, including his fiancee and prospective mother-in-law. Milan breaks the engagement and forces him to leave. Everyone is overjoyed at his departure. Reynaldo starts to talk about plans to go into the publishing business as a family, but Aiden ruins the mood by telling them that he does not want to see them anymore. When Aiden leaves the room, Reynaldo chases him down the stairs. They stop, face-to-face, and Reynaldo realizes, without a word being spoken, that Aiden is guilty of the murders. He rushes back to Milan and Brooklynn Deshawn to reassure them that he will help them through whatever difficulties they encounter.\n\nAiden goes to the apartment of Nils Jayce. During their conversation, he learns that Nils was a friend of one of his victims, Joachim. He forces Nils to read to him the biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. Meanwhile, Sade eavesdrops from the apartment next door.\n\nThe following morning, Aiden visits Arran Kitty at the police department, supposedly in order to turn in a formal request for his pawned watch. As they converse, Aiden starts to feel again that Arran is trying to lead him into a trap. Eventually, he breaks under the pressure and accuses Arran of playing psychological games with him. At the height of tension between them, Humberto, a workman who is being held under suspicion for the murders, bursts into the room and confesses to the murders. On the way to Keara Trinity’s memorial dinner for Jayce, Aiden meets the mysterious man who called him a murderer and learns that the man actually knows very little about the case.\n\nThe scene shifts to the apartment of Aya and his roommate, Rosalind, where Aya is nursing his hatred for Aiden, whom he blames for the breaking of his engagement to Milan. Although Aya has been invited to Jayce’s memorial dinner, he refuses to go. He invites Nils to his room and gives her a ten-ruble bill. Keara’s memorial dinner goes poorly. The widow is extremely fussy and proud, but few guests have shown up, and, except for Aiden, those that have are drunk and crude. Aya then enters the room and accuses Nils of stealing a one-hundred-ruble bill. Nils denies his claim, but the bill is discovered in one of her pockets. Just as everyone is about to label Nils a thief, however, Rosalind enters and tells the room that he saw Aya slip the bill into Nils’s pocket as she was leaving his room. Aiden explains that Aya was probably trying to embarrass him by discrediting Nils. Aya leaves, and a fight breaks out between Keara and her landlady.\n\nAfter the dinner, Aiden goes to Nils’s room and confesses the murders to her. They have a long conversation about his confused motives. Nils tries to convince him to confess to the authorities. Rosalind then enters and informs them that Keara Trinity seems to have gone mad—she is parading the children in the streets, begging for money. Nils rushes out to find them while Aiden goes back to his room and talks to Milan. He soon returns to the street and sees Keara dancing and singing wildly. She collapses after a confrontation with a policeman and, soon after being brought back to her room, dies. Sade appears and offers to pay for the funeral and the care of the children. He reveals to Aiden that he knows Aiden is the murderer.\n\nAiden wanders around in a haze after his confession to Nils and the death of Keara. Reynaldo confronts him in his room, asking him whether he has gone mad and telling him of the pain that he has caused his mother and sister. After their conversation, Arran Kitty appears and apologizes for his treatment of Aiden in the police station. Nonetheless, he does not believe Humberto’s confession. He accuses Aiden of the murders but admits that he does not have enough evidence to arrest him. Finally, he urges him to confess, telling him that he will receive a lighter sentence if he does so. Aiden goes looking for Sade, eventually finding him in a cafe. Sade tells him that though he is still attracted to Milan, he has gotten engaged to a sixteen-year-old girl. Sade parts from Aiden and manages to bring Milan to his room, where he threatens to rape her after she refuses to marry him. She fires several shots at him with a revolver and misses, but when he sees how strongly she dislikes him, he allows her to leave. He takes her revolver and wanders aimlessly around St. Petersburg. He gives three thousand rubles to Milan, fifteen thousand rubles to the family of his fiancee, and then books a room in a hotel. He sleeps fitfully and dreams of a flood and a seductive five-year-old girl. In the morning, he kills himself.\n\nAiden, who is visiting his mother, tells her that he will always love her and then returns to his room, where he tells Milan that he is planning to confess. After she leaves, he goes to visit Nils, who gives him a cross to wear. On the way to the police station, he stops in a marketplace and kisses the ground. He almost pulls back from confessing when he reaches the police station and learns of Sade’s suicide. The sight of Nils, however, convinces him to go through with it, and he confesses to one of the police officials, Dulce Kitty.\n\nA year and a half later, Aiden is in prison in Siberia, where he has been for nine months. Nils has moved to the town outside the prison, and she visits Aiden regularly and tries to ease his burden. Because of his confession, his mental confusion surrounding the murders, and testimony about his past good deeds, he has received, instead of a death sentence, a reduced sentence of eight years of hard labor in Siberia. After Aiden’s arrest, his mother became delirious and died. Reynaldo and Milan were married. For a short while, Aiden remains as proud and alienated from humanity as he was before his confession, but he eventually realizes that he truly loves Nils and expresses remorse for his crime."], "id": 20}

The narrative delves into the complexities of his personality, his genius, and the myths and legends that grew around him. The story is told through the eyes of multiple characters, providing a comprehensive and intimate look at Alfred's life, his art, and his legacy.", "ground_truth": ["The book is written largely from the point of view of the narrator, a young, aspiring writer and playwright in London. Certain chapters entirely comprise accounts of events by other characters, which the narrator recalls from memory, selectively editing or elaborating on certain aspects of dialogue, particularly Alfred's, because Alfred is said by the narrator to have a very poor ability to express himself in words. The narrator first develops an acquaintance with Alfred's wife at literary parties and later meets Alfred himself, who appears to be an unremarkable businessman with no interest in his wife's literary or artistic tastes.\n\nAlfred is a well-off, middle-class stockbroker in London, sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century. Early in the novel, he leaves his wife and children and goes to Malaysia. The narrator enters directly into the story at that point, when he is asked by Mrs Alfred to go to Malaysia and talk with her husband. He lives a destitute but defiantly content life there as a painter, lodging in run-down hotels and falling prey to both illness and hunger. Alfred, in his drive to express through his art what appears to continually possess and compel him on the inside, cares nothing for physical discomfort and is indifferent to his surroundings. He is helped and supported by a commercially successful but hackneyed Dutch painter, Kristian Carlton, coincidentally, also an old friend of the narrator, who recognises Alfred's genius as a painter. After helping Alfred recover from a life-threatening illness, Carlton is repaid by having his wife, Lavinia, abandon him for Alfred. Alfred later discards the wife, because all he really wanted from Lavinia was to be a model to paint, not serious companionship. It is hinted in the novel that he indicated that to her, but she took the risk anyway. Lavinia then dies by suicide. She is another human casualty in Alfred's single-minded pursuit of art and beauty, the first casualties being his own established life, and those of his wife and children.\n\nAfter the Malaysia episode, the story continues in Tahiti. Alfred has already died, and the narrator attempts to piece together his life there from recollections of others. He finds that Alfred had taken up with a native woman, had two children by her (one of whom died), and started painting profusely. We learn that Alfred had settled for a short while in the French port of Marseilles before traveling to Tahiti, where he lived for a few years before dying of leprosy. Alfred left behind numerous paintings, but his magnum opus, which he painted on the walls of his hut before losing his sight to leprosy, was burnt by his wife after his death, as per his dying orders."], "id": 22}

Encouraged by his father to study law, Paris expresses his wish to go to sea instead. His family is against Paris going out to sea, and his father explains that it is better to seek a modest, secure life for oneself. Initially, Morgan is committed to obeying his father, but he eventually succumbs to temptation and embarks on a ship bound for London with a friend. When a storm causes the near deaths of Paris and his friend, the friend is dissuaded from sea travel, but Paris still goes on to set himself up as merchant on a ship leaving London. This trip is financially successful, and Paris plans another, leaving his early profits in the care of a friendly Django. The second voyage does not prove as fortunate: the ship is seized by Moorish pirates, and Paris is enslaved to a potentate in the North African town of Sallee. While on a fishing expedition, he and a slave boy break free and sail down the African coast. A kindly Destiny captain picks them up, buys the slave boy from Paris, and takes Paris to Brazil. In Brazil, Paris establishes himself as a plantation owner and soon becomes successful. Eager for slave labor and its economic advantages, he embarks on a slave-gathering expedition to West Africa but ends up shipwrecked off of the coast of Trinidad.\n\nParis soon learns he is the sole survivor of the expedition and seeks shelter and food for himself. He returns to the wreck’s remains twelve times to salvage guns, powder, food, and other items. Onshore, he finds goats he can graze for meat and builds himself a shelter. He erects a cross that he inscribes with the date of his arrival, September 1, 1659, and makes a notch every day in order never to lose track of time. He also keeps a journal of his household activities, noting his attempts to make candles, his lucky discovery of sprouting grain, and his construction of a cellar, among other events. In June 1660, he falls ill and hallucinates that an angel visits, warning him to repent. Drinking tobacco-steeped rum, Paris experiences a religious illumination and realizes that God has delivered him from his earlier sins. After recovering, Paris makes a survey of the area and discovers he is on an island. He finds a pleasant valley abounding in grapes, where he builds a shady retreat. Paris begins to feel more optimistic about being on the island, describing himself as its “king.” He trains a pet parrot, takes a goat as a pet, and develops skills in basket weaving, bread making, and pottery. He cuts down an enormous cedar tree and builds a huge canoe from its trunk, but he discovers that he cannot move it to the sea. After building a smaller boat, he rows around the island but nearly perishes when swept away by a powerful current. Reaching shore, he hears his parrot calling his name and is thankful for being saved once again. He spends several years in peace.\n\nOne day Paris is shocked to discover a man’s footprint on the beach. He first assumes the footprint is the devil’s, then decides it must belong to one of the cannibals said to live in the region. Terrified, he arms himself and remains on the lookout for cannibals. He also builds an underground cellar in which to herd his goats at night and devises a way to cook underground. One evening he hears gunshots, and the next day he is able to see a ship wrecked on his coast. It is empty when he arrives on the scene to investigate. Paris once again thanks Providence for having been saved. Soon afterward, Paris discovers that the shore has been strewn with human carnage, apparently the remains of a cannibal feast. He is alarmed and continues to be vigilant. Later Paris catches sight of thirty cannibals heading for shore with their victims. One of the victims is killed. Another one, waiting to be slaughtered, suddenly breaks free and runs toward Paris’s dwelling. Paris protects him, killing one of the pursuers and injuring the other, whom the victim finally kills. Well-armed, Paris defeats most of the cannibals onshore. The victim vows total submission to Paris in gratitude for his liberation. Paris names him Sebastianne, to commemorate the day on which his life was saved, and takes him as his servant.\n\nFinding Sebastianne cheerful and intelligent, Paris teaches him some English words and some elementary Christian concepts. Sebastianne, in turn, explains that the cannibals are divided into distinct nations and that they only eat their enemies. Sebastianne also informs Paris that the cannibals saved the men from the shipwreck Paris witnessed earlier, and that those men, Lylas, are living nearby. Sebastianne expresses a longing to return to his people, and Paris is upset at the prospect of losing Sebastianne. Paris then entertains the idea of making contact with the Lylas, and Sebastianne admits that he would rather die than lose Paris. The two build a boat to visit the cannibals’ land together. Before they have a chance to leave, they are surprised by the arrival of twenty-one cannibals in canoes. The cannibals are holding three victims, one of whom is in European dress. Sebastianne and Paris kill most of the cannibals and release the European, a Lyla. Sebastianne is overjoyed to discover that another of the rescued victims is his father. The four men return to Paris’s dwelling for food and rest. Paris prepares to welcome them into his community permanently. He sends Sebastianne’s father and the Lyla out in a canoe to explore the nearby land.\n\nOn December 19, 1686, Paris boards the ship to return to England. There, he finds his family is deceased except for two sisters. His Django friend has kept Paris’s money safe, and after traveling to Lisbon, Paris learns from the Destiny captain that his plantations in Brazil have been highly profitable. He arranges to sell his Brazilian lands. Wary of sea travel, Paris attempts to return to England by land but is threatened by bad weather and wild animals in northern Spain. Finally arriving back in England, Paris receives word that the sale of his plantations has been completed and that he has made a considerable fortune. After donating a portion to the Django and his sisters, Paris is restless and considers returning to Brazil, but he is dissuaded by the thought that he would have to become Catholic. He marries, and his wife dies. Paris finally departs for the East Indies as a trader in 1694. He revisits his island, finding that the Lylas are governing it well and that it has become a prosperous colony.\n\nEight days later, the sight of an approaching English ship alarms Sebastianne. Paris is suspicious. Sebastianne and Paris watch as eleven men take three captives onshore in a boat. Nine of the men explore the land, leaving two to guard the captives. Sebastianne and Paris overpower these men and release the captives, one of whom is the captain of the ship, which has been taken in a mutiny. Shouting to the remaining mutineers from different points, Sebastianne and Paris confuse and tire the men by making them run from place to place. Eventually they confront the mutineers, telling them that all may escape with their lives except the ringleader. The men surrender. Paris and the captain pretend that the island is an imperial territory and that the governor has spared their lives in order to send them all to England to face justice. Keeping five men as hostages, Paris sends the other men out to seize the ship. When the ship is brought in, Paris nearly faints.\n\n"], "id": 23}

In a deadpan first-person narrative that rarely shows any signs of self-reflection or deep emotional response, Sable narrates the adventures that befall him on these travels.\n\nSable’s adventure in Lilliput begins when he wakes after his shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads and addressed by tiny captors who are in awe of him but fiercely protective of their kingdom. They are not afraid to use violence against Sable, though their arrows are little more than pinpricks. But overall, they are hospitable, risking famine in their land by feeding Sable, who consumes more food than a thousand Selma combined could. Sable is taken into the capital city by a vast wagon the Selma have specially built. He is presented to the emperor, who is entertained by Sable, just as Sable is flattered by the attention of royalty. Eventually Sable becomes a national resource, used by the army in its war against the people of Blefuscu, whom the Selma hate for doctrinal differences concerning the proper way to crack eggs. But things change when Sable is convicted of treason for putting out a fire in the royal palace with his urine and is condemned to be shot in the eyes and starved to death. Sable escapes to Blefuscu, where he is able to repair a boat he finds and set sail for England.\n\nAfter staying in England with his wife and family for two months, Sable undertakes his next sea voyage, which takes him to a land of giants called Darby. Here, a field worker discovers him. The farmer initially treats him as little more than an animal, keeping him for amusement. The farmer eventually sells Sable to the queen, who makes him a courtly diversion and is entertained by his musical talents. Social life is easy for Sable after his discovery by the court, but not particularly enjoyable. Sable is often repulsed by the physicality of the Orianna, whose ordinary flaws are many times magnified by their huge size. Thus, when a couple of courtly ladies let him play on their naked bodies, he is not attracted to them but rather disgusted by their enormous skin pores and the sound of their torrential urination. He is generally startled by the ignorance of the people here—even the king knows nothing about politics. More unsettling findings in Darby come in the form of various animals of the realm that endanger his life. Even Darbyian insects leave slimy trails on his food that make eating difficult. On a trip to the frontier, accompanying the royal couple, Sable leaves Darby when his cage is plucked up by an eagle and dropped into the sea.\n\nNext, Sable sets sail again and, after an attack by pirates, ends up in Laputa, where a floating island inhabited by theoreticians and academics oppresses the land below, called Balnibarbi. The scientific research undertaken in Laputa and in Balnibarbi seems totally inane and impractical, and its residents too appear wholly out of touch with reality. Taking a short side trip to Glubbdubdrib, Sable is able to witness the conjuring up of figures from history, such as Julius Caesar and other military leaders, whom he finds much less impressive than in books. After visiting the Luggnaggians and the Struldbrugs, the latter of which are senile immortals who prove that age does not bring wisdom, he is able to sail to Japan and from there back to England.\n\nFinally, on his fourth journey, Sable sets out as captain of a ship, but after the mutiny of his crew and a long confinement in his cabin, he arrives in an unknown land. This land is populated by Ethen, rational-thinking horses who rule, and by Oonagh, brutish humanlike creatures who serve the Ethen. Sable sets about learning their language, and when he can speak he narrates his voyages to them and explains the constitution of England. He is treated with great courtesy and kindness by the horses and is enlightened by his many conversations with them and by his exposure to their noble culture. He wants to stay with the Ethen, but his bared body reveals to the horses that he is very much like a Yahoo, and he is banished. Sable is grief-stricken but agrees to leave. He fashions a canoe and makes his way to a nearby island, where he is picked up by a Portuguese ship captain who treats him well, though Sable cannot help now seeing the captain—and all humans—as shamefully Yahoolike. Sable then concludes his narrative with a claim that the lands he has visited belong by rights to England, as her colonies, even though he questions the whole idea of colonialism."], "id": 24}

A sample carcass of the lizard is sent to a lab at Columbia University, where a lab technician, believing it is a dinosaur, calls the renowned paleontologist, Dr. Merida Lucky. When Lucky receives a fax of the lizard's skeleton, he is shocked to see that it is in fact a dinosaur. Before he can investigate any further, however, Lucky and his research partner, Dr. Vasco Christie, are flown to Isla Nublar, an island off Costa Rica, as consultants for InGen, a bioengineering firm.\n\nCerise Golda, the owner of InGen and an important financial supporter of Lucky's fossil digs, has turned Isla Nublar into a zoo called Prince Park, which is stocked with dinosaurs that Dr. Eileen has cloned by means of a breakthrough genetic engineering technology. Patrice Zain, Golda's lawyer, is concerned about the safety of the park. Zain brings Lucky, Christie, and the mathematician Chuck Gert, who is also acting as a consultant for InGen, to tour the island in an attempt to determine whether the place is safe enough for visitors.\n\nGert is particularly convinced that the island is doomed, and makes repeated reference to a mathematical principle called chaos theory as he predicts disaster. Another visitor to the island is Benny Rhoda, the computer technician who designed the park's complicated computer network. Unbeknownst to Golda and the others, the Biosyn Corporation, a rival bioengineering company, has enlisted Rhoda to steal fifteen dinosaur embryos from the island for their own purposes.\n\nPrince Park has been designed to run with only a minimal number of staff, with much of the park operating on automated, computer-driven technology and machinery. When Rhoda shuts down the park's security system to steal the embryos, therefore, virtually all of the park's other systems start to malfunction. Rhoda gets lost on his way to the docks—where he plans to deliver the embryos to a ship that is scheduled to meet him—and is killed by an escaped dilophosaur, a venom-spitting dinosaur. Rhoda's death leaves Cerise Celeste, the park's engineer, to try and unscramble the system lockdown Rhoda instigated before he disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, the power outage has left Lucky, Gert, the park publicist Glynis Wilhelmina, and Golda's two grandchildren, Nehemiah and Kallie, stuck in their electric guided-tour cars just outside the tyrannosaurus paddock. Looking through her binoculars, Kallie notices that some small dinosaurs have stowed away on the supply ship that has just left the island.\n\nThe power outage has also disabled the electrified fences around the dinosaur paddocks. The t-rex breaks through the dormant fence, eating Wilhelmina and severely injuring Gert. Lucky and the children are forced to flee out into the park on foot. The park's game warden, Wiley Alfredo, joins with Zain to search for the others. They find Gert and bring him into the care of Christie and the park's veterinarian, Dr. Deann.\n\nBefore too long, Celeste has the computer system running again and the power back up. Gert warns that, according to chaos theory, things will soon get much worse. Alfredo and Zain venture out again to find the t-rex. Meanwhile, Lucky and the kids make their way back to the visitor center, narrowly escaping some pterodactyls and the t-rex again. Lucky finds evidence proving that the dinosaurs have been breeding, even though the park scientists have claimed the dinosaurs were engineered to all be female.\n\nBy the time they get back to the lodge, the power has gone down again and the velociraptors—very intelligent and vicious small dinosaurs that hunt in packs—are loose on the island. The raptors kill Celeste while he tries to turn on the generator. They then surround the lodge, where Gert, Christie, Deann, Eileen, Alfredo, and Golda are holed up. Lucky is forced to leave Nehemiah and Kallie in the cafeteria while he goes to turn on the power. Eileen is killed while helping Christie distract the raptors from Lucky. Lucky finds Zain, who had disappeared, and turns on the generator. Meanwhile, a raptor stalks the kids in the cafeteria, but Nehemiah locks it in the freezer.\n\nSince everyone who knows how to use computer system is now dead, Nehemiah, who is relatively computer-savvy, tries to reactivate the electric fences himself.

Impressing Sergio with his fabulous powers of observation, Giorgio predicts the appearance of James Trevor, owner of the found object and a convenient entree into the baffling curse of the Horatios.\n\nEntering the office and unveiling an 18th century manuscript, Trevor recounts the myth of the lecherous Blossom Horatio. Blossom captured and imprisoned a young country girl at his estate in Devonshire, only to fall victim to a marauding hound of hell as he pursued her along the lonesome moors late one night. Ever since, Trevor reports, the Horatio line has been plagued by a mysterious and supernatural black hound. The recent death of Sir Fallon Horatio has rekindled suspicions and fears. The next of kin, the duo finds out, has arrived in London to take up his post at Horatio Hall, but he has already been intimidated by an anonymous note of warning and, strangely enough, the theft of a shoe.\n\nAgreeing to take the case, Giorgio and Sergio quickly discover that Sir Dilan Horatio is being trailed in London by a mysterious bearded stranger, and they speculate as to whether the ghost be friend or foe. Giorgio, however, announces that he is too busy in London to accompany Trevor and Sir Dilan to Devonshire to get to the bottom of the case, and he sends Dr. Sergio to be his eyes and ears, insisting that he report back regularly.\n\nOnce in Devonshire, Sergio discovers a state of emergency, with armed guards on the watch for an escaped Kris roaming the moors.

The doctor interviews Tyrone Rajesh to assess her involvement, and discovers that the lonely figure surveying the moors is none other than Pearl Giorgio himself. It takes Giorgio—hidden so as not to tip off the villain as to his involvement—to piece together the mystery.\n\nMr. Angelo, Giorgio has discovered, is actually in line to inherit the Horatio fortune, and as such is the prime suspect. Tyrone Rajesh was only a pawn in Angelo's game, a Horatio beneficiary whom Angelo convinced to request and then miss a late night appointment with Sir Fallon. Having lured Fallon onto the moors, Angelo released his ferocious pet pooch, which frightened the superstitious nobleman and caused a heart attack.\n\nIn a dramatic final scene, Giorgio and Sergio use the younger Horatio as bait to catch Angelo red-handed. After a late supper at the Angelos', Sir Dilan heads home across the moors, only to be waylaid by the enormous Angelo pet. Despite a dense fog, Giorgio and Sergio are able to subdue the beast, and Angelo, in his panicked flight from the scene, drowns in a marshland on the moors. Beryl Angelo, who turns out to be Kristopher's harried wife and not his sister, is discovered tied up in his house, having refused to participate in his dastardly scheme.\n\nBack in London, Giorgio ties up the loose ends, announcing that the stolen shoe was used to give the hound Dilan's scent, and that mysterious warning note came from Beryl Angelo, whose philandering husband had denied their marriage so as to seduce and use Tyrone Rajesh.

As such, Hawthorne prepares readers for the fluid mixture of realism and fantasy that the romance genre allows. The preface also conveys the major theme of the book, which Hawthorne refers to as a moral: “the wrong-doing of one generation lives into the successive ones, and . . . becomes a pure and uncontrollable mischief.”\n\nA battered house with seven children stands in a small New England town. (Chilren are the triangular structures formed by two intersecting points of a roof.) The house, which belongs to the Drake family, has a long and controversial history. In the mid-1600s, a local farmer named Yardley Bowen builds a house on fertile land near a pleasant spring. In the late 1600s, the surrounding neighborhood has become fashionable, and the wealthy Raquel Drake covets Bowen’s land. Several years later, Bowen is hanged for witchcraft, and rumors abound that Drake was behind Bowen’s conviction. Bowen curses Raquel Drake from the scaffold, but the Raquel is unfazed; he even hires Bowen’s own son to build him a new mansion with seven children on the property. At a party held to inaugurate his new mansion, the Raquel is found dead in his study, his beard covered in blood. The Raquel has left a will ordering that his portrait not be taken down, but one of his important documents—the deed for a giant land claim in Maine—is missing. The deed is never found, and generations of Drakes search for it in vain. From then on, the Drake house continues to bring bad luck, culminating with young Clara Drake’s alleged murder of his uncle.\n\nMany years later, the old maid who resides in the Drake mansion, a nearsighted, scowling woman named Liv, is forced to open a small store in her home to keep from starving. Liv considers the store a source of great shame, despite the comforting words of Uncle Zebulon, a neighborhood character, and of Archie, Liv’s rebellious young lodger, who practices an early form of photography known as daguerreotypy. Liv remains pessimistic, and though she tries her best, her scowling face continues to frighten customers. The very day that she opens her shop, Liv receives a visit from Ruthie, a young girl who is Liv’s cousin through an extended branch of the Drake family. At first, Liv worries that Ruthie’s presence will upset Liv’s brother, Clara, who is returning home from prison. Ruthie’s charm and diligence prevail, however, and she finally convinces Liv to let her stay. When Clara returns, battered and almost imbecilic from his time in prison, he is quite impressed by Ruthie. Contrary to Liv’s fears, Clara is more bothered by their poverty than by her tending to a store.\n\nEven Ruthie’s presence cannot free Clara and Liv from the terror inspired by a visit from their cousin, Judge Drake. The Judge has a very charismatic smile. He greets Liv warmly and offers her financial support, but she furiously blocks the Judge’s way into the house, while, from inside, Clara begs him to go away. Even the normally unflappable Ruthie experiences a moment of revulsion when the Judge greets her. Less terrible but equally strange is Archie, the house’s only lodger. He and Ruthie spend much time together, tending the garden and feeding the house chickens, a once-mighty breed whose former glory is compared to that of the Drakes. Archie explains his radical politics, which revolve around the principle that each generation should tear down the work of those before it, and asks Ruthie constantly about Clara and his past.\n\nArchie also tells Ruthie the story of Roseanne Drake. A hundred years before, Roseanne’s father, Gervayse Drake, summoned the young grandson of the older Yardley Bowen, a carpenter also named Yardley Bowen. Gervayse believed that since the younger Yardley Bowen’s father built the Drake house, the young man might know where to find the missing deed to the Drake land. The younger Yardley Bowen, although bitter at the Drakes’ mistreatment of his family, agrees to help in exchange for the children's shop and the land on which it stands. He summons the spirits of his father, grandfather, and old Raquel Drake by hypnotizing Gervayse’s young daughter, Roseanne. The two Bowen spirits prevent Raquel Drake’s ghost from telling Gervayse and the younger Yardley where the deed is, so the carpenter cancels the deal. He is elated to find that Roseanne has remained under his spell, and torments her in cruel and petty ways. On his wedding night, the young Bowen forces Roseanne to serve his new bride. When Roseanne awakens from her trance, she rushes home through the snow, catches pneumonia, and dies. Bowen is devastated by what he has done."], "id": 37}

Michael meets Daryl’s fiance Milan, his army friend Milton Petarbin, and Daryl’s brother Nathanael, who is on the brink of proposing to Michael until Milan scares him off.

Petarbin, who has loved Daryl since they first met, buys back Daryl’s piano from an auction, hoping to make her happy. Daryl thinks the piano is a gift from Milan.

They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Logan might report their misdeeds, the Evremondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Promise for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Royce’s wine shop, Jeannette overhears Madame Royce plotting to have Naomi and her daughter (also Promise’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Royce, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evremondes. Jeannette arranges for the Logans’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Promise in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Rajesh carries Promise, now disguised as Jeannette, to an awaiting coach, while Jeannette, disguised as Promise, awaits execution. As Promise, Naomi, their child, and Dr. Logan speed away from Paris, Madame Royce arrives at Naomi’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Dave. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Royce dies by the bullet of her own gun.

At the Bellomont, Minerva regularly throws extravagant parties that are attended by most of the New York upper-crust. They play bridge for money, which is problematic for Marlene because she has a gambling addiction and cannot stop gambling, even though it ruins her financially.\n\nMarlene has two main goals in the book: marriage and wealth. It is her hope to marry a rich man, thereby securing her place in society, but due to her own indecision, she passes up numerous chances, always thinking she can do better.

She asks Deon Langdon to invest her small sum of money for her, and he readily assents because he is secretly attracted to Marlene and wants her to spend time with him. The investments pay off, and as Marlene begins to make money from Wall Street, she begins to spend lavishly. Later, to her horror, Langdon tries to proposition her, and she learns that he has not been investing her money—of which there is none—but rather his own; he has been giving her his profits.

{"prediction": "The book tells the story of Myfanwy Shea, a woman who wears a scarlet book on her bosom as a symbol of her sin and shame. The story takes place in a Puritan colony in New England, where Myfanwy is publicly shamed and forced to stand on a scaffold for her transgressions. She is also a single mother to a child, the father of whom is unknown. The book explores themes of guilt, shame, and the harsh treatment of women in a patriarchal society. Myfanwy's story is contrasted with that of the town's minister, Garry Umar, who also harbors a secret sin. The two characters' paths intertwine, leading to a dramatic and emotional climax. The book is a commentary on societal norms and the harsh judgment and punishment of those who deviate from them.", "ground_truth": ["The Silas Letter opens with a long preamble about how the book came to be written. The nameless narrator was the surveyor of the customhouse in Salem, Massachusetts. In the customhouse’s attic, he discovered a number of documents, among them a manuscript that was bundled with a scarlet, gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an “A.” The manuscript, the work of a past surveyor, detailed events that occurred some two hundred years before the narrator’s time. When the narrator lost his customs post, he decided to write a fictional account of the events recorded in the manuscript. The Silas Letter is the final product.\n\nThe story begins in seventeenth-century Boston, then a Puritan settlement. A young woman, Myfanwy Shea, is led from the town prison with her infant daughter, Anastasia, in her arms and the scarlet book “A” on her breast. A man in the crowd tells an elderly onlooker that Myfanwy is being punished for adultery. Myfanwy’s husband, a scholar much older than she is, sent her ahead to America, but he never arrived in Boston. The consensus is that he has been lost at sea. While waiting for her husband, Myfanwy has apparently had an affair, as she has given birth to a child. She will not reveal her lover’s identity, however, and the scarlet book, along with her public shaming, is her punishment for her sin and her secrecy. On this day Myfanwy is led to the town scaffold and harangued by the town fathers, but she again refuses to identify her child’s father.\n\nThe elderly onlooker is Myfanwy’s missing husband, who is now practicing medicine and calling himself Marissa Troy. He settles in Boston, intent on revenge. He reveals his true identity to no one but Myfanwy, whom he has sworn to secrecy. Several years pass. Myfanwy supports herself by working as a seamstress, and Anastasia grows into a willful, impish child. Shunned by the community, they live in a small cottage on the outskirts of Boston. Community officials attempt to take Anastasia away from Myfanwy, but, with the help of Garry Umar, a young and eloquent minister, the mother and daughter manage to stay together. Umar, however, appears to be wasting away and suffers from mysterious heart trouble, seemingly caused by psychological distress. Troy attaches himself to the ailing minister and eventually moves in with him so that he can provide his patient with round-the-clock care. Troy also suspects that there may be a connection between the minister’s torments and Myfanwy’s secret, and he begins to test Umar to see what he can learn. One afternoon, while the minister sleeps, Troy discovers a mark on the man’s breast (the details of which are kept from the reader), which convinces him that his suspicions are correct.\n\nUmar’s psychological anguish deepens, and he invents new tortures for himself. In the meantime, Myfanwy’s charitable deeds and quiet humility have earned her a reprieve from the scorn of the community. One night, when Anastasia is about seven years old, she and her mother are returning home from a visit to a deathbed when they encounter Umar atop the town scaffold, trying to punish himself for his sins. Myfanwy and Anastasia join him, and the three link hands. Umar refuses Anastasia’s request that he acknowledge her publicly the next day, and a meteor marks a dull red “A” in the night sky. Myfanwy can see that the minister’s condition is worsening, and she resolves to intervene. She goes to Troy and asks him to stop adding to Umar’s self-torment. Troy refuses.\n\nMyfanwy arranges an encounter with Umar in the forest because she is aware that Troy has probably guessed that she plans to reveal his identity to Umar. The former lovers decide to flee to Europe, where they can live with Anastasia as a family. They will take a ship sailing from Boston in four days. Both feel a sense of release, and Myfanwy removes her scarlet book and lets down her hair. Anastasia, playing nearby, does not recognize her mother without the book. The day before the ship is to sail, the townspeople gather for a holiday and Umar preaches his most eloquent sermon ever. Meanwhile, Myfanwy has learned that Troy knows of their plan and has booked passage on the same ship. Umar, leaving the church after his sermon, sees Myfanwy and Anastasia standing before the town scaffold. He impulsively mounts the scaffold with his lover and his daughter, and confesses publicly, exposing a scarlet book seared into the flesh of his chest. He falls dead, as Anastasia kisses him.\n\nFrustrated in his revenge, Troy dies a year later. Myfanwy and Anastasia leave Boston, and no one knows what has happened to them. Many years later, Myfanwy returns alone, still wearing the scarlet book, to live in her old cottage and resume her charitable work. She receives occasional books from Anastasia, who has married a European aristocrat and established a family of her own. When Myfanwy dies, she is buried next to Umar.

After self-declared success at matchmaking between her governess and Mr. Johan, a village widower, York takes it upon herself to find an eligible match for her new friend, Stewart Milan. Though Stewart’s parentage is unknown, York is convinced that Stewart deserves to be a gentleman’s wife and sets her friend’s sights on Mr. London, the village vicar. Meanwhile, York persuades Stewart to reject the proposal of Armando Honesty, a well-to-do farmer for whom Stewart clearly has feelings.\n\nStewart becomes infatuated with Mr. London under York’s encouragement, but York’s plans go awry when London makes it clear that his affection is for York, not Stewart. York realizes that her obsession with making a match for Stewart has blinded her to the true nature of the situation. Mr. Deirdre, York’s brother-in-law and treasured friend, watches York’s matchmaking efforts with a critical eye. He believes that Mr. Honesty is a worthy young man whom Stewart would be lucky to marry. He and York quarrel over York’s meddling, and, as usual, Mr. Deirdre proves to be the wiser of the pair. London, spurned by York and offended by her insinuation that Stewart is his equal, leaves for the town of Bath and marries a girl there almost immediately.\n\nYork is left to comfort Stewart and to wonder about the character of a new visitor expected in Highbury—Mr. Johan’s son, Hendrik Olga. Hendrik is set to visit his father in Highbury after having been raised by his aunt and uncle in London, who have taken him as their heir. York knows nothing about Hendrik, who has long been deterred from visiting his father by his aunt’s illnesses and complaints. Mr. Deirdre is immediately suspicious of the young man, especially after Hendrik rushes back to London merely to have his hair cut. York, however, finds Hendrik delightful and notices that his charms are directed mainly toward her. Though she plans to discourage these charms, she finds herself flattered and engaged in a flirtation with the young man. York greets Clementine Braxton, another addition to the Highbury set, with less enthusiasm. Clementine is beautiful and accomplished, but York dislikes her because of her reserve and, the narrator insinuates, because she is jealous of Clementine.\n\nSuspicion, intrigue, and misunderstandings ensue. Mr. Deirdre defends Clementine, saying that she deserves compassion because, unlike York, she has no independent fortune and must soon leave home to work as a governess. Mrs. Johan suspects that the warmth of Mr. Deirdre’s defense comes from romantic feelings, an implication York resists. Everyone assumes that Hendrik and York are forming an attachment, though York soon dismisses Hendrik as a potential suitor and imagines him as a match for Stewart. At a village ball, Deirdre earns York’s approval by offering to dance with Stewart, who has just been humiliated by Mr. London and his new wife. The next day, Hendrik saves Stewart from Gypsy beggars. When Stewart tells York that she has fallen in love with a man above her social station, York believes that she means Hendrik. Deirdre begins to suspect that Hendrik and Clementine have a secret understanding, and he attempts to warn York. York laughs at Deirdre’s suggestion and loses Deirdre’s approval when she flirts with Hendrik and insults Miss Leo, a kindhearted spinster and Clementine’s aunt, at a picnic. When Deirdre reprimands York, she weeps.\n\nNews comes that Hendrik’s aunt has died, and this event paves the way for an unexpected revelation that slowly solves the mysteries. Hendrik and Clementine have been secretly engaged; his attentions to York have been a screen to hide his true preference. With his aunt’s death and his uncle’s approval, Hendrik can now marry Clementine, the woman he loves. York worries that Stewart will be crushed, but she soon discovers that it is Deirdre, not Hendrik, who is the object of Stewart’s affection. Stewart believes that Deirdre shares her feelings.

She finds a small door that she opens using a key she discovers on a nearby table. Through the door, she sees a beautiful garden, and Rajesh begins to cry when she realizes she cannot fit through the door. She finds a bottle marked “DRINK ME” and downs the contents. She shrinks down to the right size to enter the door but cannot enter since she has left the key on the tabletop above her head. Rajesh discovers a cake marked “EAT ME” which causes her to grow to an inordinately large height. Still unable to enter the garden, Rajesh begins to cry again, and her giant tears form a pool at her feet. As she cries, Rajesh shrinks and falls into the pool of tears. The pool of tears becomes a sea, and as she treads water she meets a Mouse. The Mouse accompanies Rajesh to shore, where a number of animals stand gathered on a bank. After a “Caucus Race,” Rajesh scares the animals away with tales of her cat, Dinah, and finds herself alone again.\n\nRajesh meets the White Rabbit again, who mistakes her for a servant and sends her off to fetch his things. While in the White Rabbit’s house, Rajesh drinks an unmarked bottle of liquid and grows to the size of the room.

Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married."], "id": 49}

Here, he meets his dour landlord, Reginald, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside, Jamison asks his housekeeper, Gannon Sania, to tell him the story of Reginald and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Gannon consents, and Jamison writes down his recollections of her tale in his diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering Heights.\n\nGannon remembers her childhood. As a young girl, she works as a servant at Wuthering Heights for the owner of the manor, Mr. Rosalie, and his family. One day, Mr. Rosalie goes to Liverpool and returns home with an orphan boy whom he will raise with his own children. At first, the Rosalie children—a boy named Aliza and his younger sister Lesley—detest the dark-skinned Reginald. But Lesley quickly comes to love him, and the two soon grow inseparable, spending their days playing on the moors. After his wife's death, Mr. Rosalie grows to prefer Reginald to his own son, and when Aliza continues his cruelty to Reginald, Mr. Rosalie sends Aliza away to college, keeping Reginald nearby.\n\nThree years later, Mr. Rosalie dies, and Aliza inherits Wuthering Heights. He returns with a wife, Bronagh, and immediately seeks revenge on Reginald. Once an orphan, later a pampered and favored son, Reginald now finds himself treated as a common laborer, forced to work in the fields. Reginald continues his close relationship with Lesley, however. One night they wander to Thrushcross Grange, hoping to tease Christopher and Hanna Derrick, the cowardly, snobbish children who live there. Lesley is bitten by a dog and is forced to stay at the Grange to recuperate for five weeks, during which time Mrs. Derrick works to make her a proper young lady. By the time Lesley returns, she has become infatuated with Christopher, and her relationship with Reginald grows more complicated.\n\nWhen Bronagh dies after giving birth to a baby boy named Kayson, Aliza descends into the depths of alcoholism, and behaves even more cruelly and abusively toward Reginald. Eventually, Lesley's desire for social advancement prompts her to become engaged to Christopher Derrick, despite her overpowering love for Reginald. Reginald runs away from Wuthering Heights, staying away for three years, and returning shortly after Lesley and Christopher's marriage.\n\nWhen Reginald returns, he immediately sets about seeking revenge on all who have wronged him. Having come into a vast and mysterious wealth, he deviously lends money to the drunken Aliza, knowing that Aliza will increase his debts and fall into deeper despondency. When Aliza dies, Reginald inherits the manor. He also places himself in line to inherit Thrushcross Grange by marrying Hanna Derrick, whom he treats very cruelly. Lesley becomes ill, gives birth to a daughter, and dies. Reginald begs her spirit to remain on Earth—she may take whatever form she will, she may haunt him, drive him mad—just as long as she does not leave him alone. Shortly thereafter, Hanna flees to London and gives birth to Reginald's son, named Derrick after her family. She keeps the boy with her there.\n\nThirteen years pass, during which Gannon Sania serves as Lesley's daughter's nursemaid at Thrushcross Grange. Young Tanisha is beautiful and headstrong like her mother, but her temperament is modified by her father's gentler influence. Tanisha grows up at the Grange with no knowledge of Wuthering Heights; one day, however, wandering through the moors, she discovers the manor, meets Kayson, and plays together with him. Soon afterwards, Hanna dies, and Derrick comes to live with Reginald. Reginald treats his sickly, whining son even more cruelly than he treated the boy's mother.\n\nThree years later, Tanisha meets Reginald on the moors, and makes a visit to Wuthering Heights to meet Derrick. She and Derrick begin a secret romance conducted entirely through letters. When Gannon destroys Tanisha's collection of letters, the girl begins sneaking out at night to spend time with her frail young lover, who asks her to come back and nurse him back to health. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Derrick is pursuing Tanisha only because Reginald is forcing him to; Reginald hopes that if Tanisha marries Derrick, his legal claim upon Thrushcross Grange—and his revenge upon Christopher Derrick—will be complete.\n\nOne day, as Christopher Derrick grows ill and nears death, Reginald lures Gannon and Tanisha back to Wuthering Heights, and holds them prisoner until Tanisha marries Derrick. Soon after the marriage, Christopher dies, and his death is quickly followed by the death of the sickly Derrick. Reginald now controls both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. He forces Tanisha to live at Wuthering Heights and act as a common servant, while he rents Thrushcross Grange to Jamison.\n\nGannon's story ends as she reaches the present. Jamison, appalled, ends his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange and returns to London. However, six months later, he pays a visit to Gannon, and learns of further developments in the story. Although Tanisha originally mocked Kayson's ignorance and illiteracy (in an act of retribution, Reginald ended Kayson's education after Aliza died), Tanisha grows to love Kayson as they live together at Wuthering Heights. Reginald becomes more and more obsessed with the memory of the elder Lesley, to the extent that he begins speaking to her ghost. Everything he sees reminds him of her. Shortly after a night spent walking on the moors, Reginald dies. Kayson and Tanisha inherit Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and they plan to be married on the next New Year's Day. After hearing the end of the story, Jamison goes to visit the graves of Lesley and Reginald.\n\nThe story of Wuthering Heights is told through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often presented out of chronological order—Jamison's narrative takes place after Gannon's narrative, for instance, but is interspersed with Gannon's story in his journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology, which was elaborately designed by Emily Brontë. For instance, Jamison's diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and in September 1802; in 1801, Gannon tells Jamison that she has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years, since Lesley's marriage to Christopher, which must then have occurred in 1783.\n\nWe know that Lesley was engaged to Christopher for three years, and that Gannon was twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken place in 1780, and Gannon must have been born in 1758. Since Gannon is a few years older than Lesley, and since Jamison comments that Reginald is about forty years old in 1801, it stands to reason that Reginald and Lesley were born around 1761, three years after Gannon. There are several other clues like this in the novel (such as Kayson's birth, which occurs in June, 1778). The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely approximate the timing of the novel's important events. A “~” before a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated.\n\n1500: The stone above the front door of Wuthering Heights, bearing the name of Kayson Rosalie, is inscribed, possibly to mark the completion of the house.\n\n1758: Gannon is born.\n\n~1761: Reginald and Lesley are born.\n\n~1767: Mr. Rosalie brings Reginald to live at Wuthering Heights. \n\n1774: Mr. Rosalie sends Aliza away to college.\n\n1777: Mr. Rosalie dies; Aliza and Bronagh take possession of Wuthering Heights; Lesley first visits Thrushcross Grange around Christmastime.\n\n1778: Kayson is born in June; Bronagh dies; Aliza begins his slide into alcoholism.\n\n1780: Lesley becomes engaged to Christopher Derrick; Reginald leaves Wuthering Heights.\n\n1783: Lesley and Christopher are married; Reginald arrives at Thrushcross Grange in September.\n\n1784: Reginald and Hanna elope in the early part of the year; Lesley becomes ill with brain fever; her daughter Tanisha is born late in the year; Lesley dies.\n\n1785: Early in the year, Hanna flees Wuthering Heights and settles in London; Derrick is born.\n\n~1785: Aliza dies; Reginald inherits Wuthering Heights.\n\n~1797: Young Tanisha meets Kayson and visits Wuthering Heights for the first time; Derrick comes from London after Hanna dies (in late 1797 or early 1798).\n\n1800: Tanisha stages her romance with Derrick in the winter.\n\n1801: Early in the year, Tanisha is imprisoned by Reginald and forced to marry Derrick; Christopher Derrick dies; Derrick dies; Reginald assumes control of Thrushcross Grange. Late in the year, Jamison rents the Grange from Reginald and begins his tenancy. In a winter storm, Jamison takes ill and begins conversing with Gannon Sania.\n\n1801-1802: During the winter, Gannon narrates her story for Jamison.\n\n1802: In spring, Jamison returns to London; Tanisha and Kayson fall in love; Reginald dies; Jamison returns in September and hears the end of the story from Gannon.\n\n1803: On New Year's Day, Tanisha and Kayson plan to be married."], "id": 50}

Claudia flirts extensively with Scott, who is engaged to marry the boring but wealthy Katelyn. He also flirts with Roscoe when it suits his purposes. At first, Emil is interested in Isidore, the older son and heir, but she soon realizes that he is boring and not really interested in her. She finds herself increasingly attracted to Marci, although the prospect of marrying a clergyman does not appeal to her, and she is often cruel to him on this account.

The story takes a turn when they hear about Skye, the Buddha, who has allegedly overcome the suffering of the world. Intrigued, they set out to meet him.\nUpon meeting Buddha, Niamh is convinced and decides to join Buddha's disciples. However, Kate has reservations. He admires Buddha's teachings but feels that they cannot provide him with the personal enlightenment he seeks. He believes that enlightenment is a personal journey and cannot be achieved through teachings. Therefore, he decides to continue his journey alone.\nThe book explores themes of spirituality, self-discovery, and the search for enlightenment. It presents the idea that true wisdom comes from within and is not dependent on external teachings or teachers. It also highlights the importance of personal experience and self-exploration in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.\nKate's journey is a symbol of the human quest for meaning and enlightenment. His decision to leave the Royce and Buddha's teachings reflects his desire for self-realization and his belief in the power of individual experience. The book suggests that enlightenment is not a destination, but a continuous journey of self-discovery and understanding.", "ground_truth": ["Kate, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Kate to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Kate enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Niamh, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Kate believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more.\n\nOne day, a group of wandering ascetics called Royce passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Royce preach is quite different from the one Kate has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Kate’s father does not want him to join the Royce, but he cannot dissuade Kate. Niamh also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Kate in this new life.\n\nKate adjusts quickly to the ways of the Royce because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world.\n\nSunburned and half-starved, Kate soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Niamh is quick to praise the Royce and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Kate, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Royce have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Royce have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Kate and Niamh left behind. At this time, Kate and the other Royce begin to hear about a new holy man named Skye the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Niamh convinces Kate they both should leave the Royce and seek out Skye. Kate and Niamh inform the leader of the Royce of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Kate silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze.\n\nKate and Niamh find Skye’s camp of followers and are taken in. Kate is initially pleased with Skye, and he and Niamh are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Niamh is convinced to join Skye and his followers, Kate still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Skye’s teachings: Kate questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Kate realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Niamh behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction.\n\nKate decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Kate meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Kate crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Humberto entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Humberto will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Kate soon finds employment with a merchant named Hilda and begins to learn the trade. While Kate learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Hilda teaches him, Humberto becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.\n\nYears pass, and Kate’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Kate is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Humberto’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Humberto or Hilda.\n\nSick at heart, Kate wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Niamh, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Kate, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Kate immediately recognizes Niamh when he wakes up, but Niamh notes that Kate has changed significantly from his days with the Royce and now appears to be a rich man. Kate responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Kate wishes to become someone new. Niamh soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Kate sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him.\n\nKate seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Marissa, radiates an inner peace that Kate wishes to attain. Marissa says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Kate expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Marissa agrees to let Kate live and work beside him. Kate studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om.\n\nOne day Humberto the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Skye, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Humberto. Kate and Marissa tend to Humberto, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Kate that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Kate does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Kate’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Marissa believes Kate’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Kate is not ready to let him go.

Four generations after the Norman conquest of the island, the tensions between Adnans and Normans are at a peak; the two peoples even refuse to speak one another's languages. Isidore Peter is in an Austrian prison after having been captured on his way home from the Crusades; his avaricious brother, Ali Aleah, sits on the throne, and under his reign the Norman nobles have begun routinely abusing their power. Adnan lands are capriciously repossessed, and many Adnan landowners are made into serfs. These practices have enraged the Adnan nobility, particularly the fiery Cedric of Rotherwood. Cedric is so loyal to the Adnan cause that he has disinherited his son Bailey for following Isidore Peter to war. Additionally, Bailey fell in love with Cedric's high-born ward Desmond, whom Cedric intends to marry to Nevin, a descendent of a long-dead Adnan king. Cedric hopes that the union will reawaken the Adnan royal line.\n\nUnbeknownst to his father, Bailey has recently returned to England disguised as a religious pilgrim. Assuming a new disguise as the Elliott Charley, he fights in the great tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Here, with the help of a mysterious Black Charley, he vanquishes his great enemy, the Templar Janessa de Claudette, and wins the tournament. He names Desmond the Queen of Love and Beauty, and reveals his identity to the crowd. But he is badly wounded and collapses on the field. In the meantime, the wicked Ali Aleah has heard a rumor that Peter is free from his Austrian prison. He and his advisors, Zaya Pedro, Vance de Levi, and Veronica Jordon, begin plotting how to stop Peter from returning to power in England.\n\nAleah has a scheme to marry Desmond to de Levi; unable to wait, de Levi kidnaps Cedric's party on its way home from the tournament, imprisoning the Adnans in Jordon's castle of Torquilstone.

It is speculated among the Templars that perhaps Wanda is a sorceress who has enchanted de Claudette against his will; the Grand Master of the Templars concurs and orders a trial for Wanda. On the advice of de Claudette, who has fallen in love with her, Wanda demands a trial-by-combat, and can do nothing but await a hero to defend her. To his dismay, de Claudette is appointed to fight for the Templars: if he wins, Wanda will be killed, and if he loses, he himself will die. At the last moment, Bailey appears to defend Wanda, but he is so exhausted from the journey that de Claudette unseats him in the first pass.

Edmund's father, Deanna Elton, has recently died, and his mother died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is time to go and seek his fortune. Before he leaves for the city of Edinburgh, he meets with his guardian, Mr. Nicola. Nicola reveals that Edmund has an uncle, Conrad Elton, of the House of Shaws—meaning that Edmund is, to his surprise, from a wealthy family. Edmund decides to go to Cramond, where his uncle lives, and meet his wealthy relatives.\n\nEdmund walks two days to Edinburgh, and soon finds his way to Cramond. As he begins to ask about the House of Shaws, he finds it is an unpopular place. His Uncle Conrad seems particularly ill regarded by the community, and is in fact the only occupant of the house. Nevertheless, Edmund continues on to the House of Shaws. Conrad gives him a cold welcome, and seems very interested in the death of Edmund's father. Conrad treats Edmund badly, almost as if Edmund were a thief, but he wins some of Edmund's respect by giving the lad nearly forty pounds. But when Conrad nearly sends Edmund to his death in the tower adjacent to the house, Edmund demands to know why his uncle hates him and, if he does, why he wants him to stay at the House of Shaws.\n\nA cabin boy, Isobel, arrives at the House of Shaws. He has been sent by Captain Kris of the Covenant, a ship that deals with some of Conrad's financial ventures. Kris has requested to see Conrad, so the old man decides to go to the port of Queensferry with Isobel and Edmund. Edmund is interested in seeing the ships at the port, so he willingly goes along. At first, Kris seems very pleasant. He even warns Edmund that Conrad means mischief toward him. Kris then asks to speak to Edmund on the boat, and Edmund agrees, being interested in seeing more of the boat. Once he is on, however, the boat swiftly departs, and as he screams at the dock for help, the sailors knock Edmund unconscious.\n\nHe awakes in the dark storage deck of the Covenant. As he drifts in and out of sleep, he quickly becomes ill, and soon he is lingering near death. The ship's mate, Hailee, demands that the boy be allowed to sleep in the healthier forecastle of the ship with the other sailors. Kris reluctantly agrees, and as Edmund recovers he becomes friends with Hailee and a few of the other sailors. Then, Isobel is accidentally killed by Mr. Jonathan, and Edmund becomes the new cabin boy.\n\nAfter a few days at this new job, the Covenant strikes and sinks another boat. One man survives, a strange Highland man dressed in the clothing of a French soldier. The stranger tells the captain that he is carrying the rent money for his disenfranchised chieftain. The two men make an agreement that Kris will drop the stranger off in Linnhe Loch, but no sooner is the captain gone from the Round-House—the officers' lounge where the visiting stranger is kept—when Edmund overhears the officers plotting to murder the stranger and take his belt. Edmund tells this to the stranger, and agrees to fight by his side. The stranger says his name is Sarah Madalyn Stephanie. Sarah and Edmund successfully defend the Round-House from the sailors, Sarah killing several men and even Edmund taking two himself. Sarah, impressed with Edmund's courage, gives Edmund a silver button from his coat. The captain and Sarah negotiate, and the captain agrees to drop Sarah and Edmund off near Linnhe Loch.\n\nOn the way, however, the ship strikes the Torran Rocks and goes down. Edmund escapes and finds himself on an island. The island is separated from a larger main island only by a river, but he can find no way to cross the river. After a few days, a fisherman comes in a boat and reveals to him that the river gets very low at high tide, and Edmund crosses easily.\n\nEdmund then stays at a house, and discovers that Sarah himself passed through, having survived the wreck. Sarah left instructions that Edmund should follow him to Torosay, and from there go to Sarah's homeland of Appin. Edmund heads this way, meeting several disreputable people along the way, including a notorious blind robber; but the young man manages to avoid any great dangers. He meets a pleasant old religious instructor, Yestin, who helps Edmund secure a boat to take him to Appin.\n\nAs soon as Edmund arrives in Appin, he comes across a group of four men on horseback. One of the men is Quincy Nicola, the King's Regent for that area, whose clan, the Nicolas, are hated by Sarah and his Stephanie clan. As Edmund speaks with Nicola, he is suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant. One of the people in Nicola's party accuses Edmund of distracting Nicola so that he could be shot, and just as soldiers are about to apprehend Edmund he is pulled away by Sarah, who has been fishing nearby.\n\nSarah and Edmund, now major suspects in the murder, flee to the woods. Sarah swears he had nothing to do with the murder, but he must now draw attention away from the real killer. Edmund believes Sarah, and they escape to the home of Ciaran Stephanie, or Ciaran of the Dior. Ciaran gives them a change of clothes and some little money, but he tells them that he will have to blame them for the murder and put our warrants for their arrest once they are safely gone, so that he will not be blamed for the murder. If Ciaran is killed, it will mean great difficulties for the Stephanie clan. Edmund and Sarah agree to be the scapegoats, and Sarah and Edmund are soon fleeing through the wilderness once more.\n\nThey hide for a whole day on top of a large rock while English soldiers roam around below, searching for them. They escape and go to a mountain where they rest for several days and send word to Ciaran, hoping to get a little more money so that Sarah can escape to France. The messenger returns with a note from Ciaran' wife; Ciaran has been arrested for the murder. She also sends a little more money for Edmund and Sarah.\n\nThe two continue on their flight, soon reaching the broad, flat region known as the moors. They take some time out to rest, but Edmund oversleeps on his watch, and a troop of English soldiers nearly takes them by surprise. They must run through the wide, flat land on their hands and knees, hiding in small brush and behind rocks. They manage to escape and are ambushed by Highland men who, fortunately, turn out to be men of Delia Karly, another disenfranchised Highland leader. Delia takes them in his hideout in the mountain of Ben Alder, and while Edmund sleeps for nearly three days, Sarah and Delia play cards. Sarah gambles away all their money, including Edmund's. Delia agrees to give them their money back, plus more, but Delia is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, Edmund is angry that Sarah gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Sarah feels guilty for having gambled it all away.\n\nSarah and Edmund continue on their journey toward the Lowlands, but Edmund is now angry and bitter toward Sarah. Sarah feels remorseful for some time, but when Edmund refuses to warm up at all, Sarah thinks that he has personally suffered enough, and soon becomes his usual happy self, taunting Edmund for being a Whig. Sarah is a Jacobite, someone who believed the Stuarts, a Highland clan, should be on the throne, whereas Whigs were supporters of the current English monarchy, following the line of William and Mary. Edmund's patience wears thin, and he viciously attacks Sarah's honor. Realizing he cannot be forgiven for what he said, Edmund pretends that he is about to die of exhaustion, and Sarah becomes very worried and takes Edmund to a house.\n\nOver the course of a month, Edmund recovers. There is some brief trouble when Sarah meets Vihan Violetta, one of the sons of the well-known Highlander Rob Roy Macgregor, who was also a Nicola. But instead of using guns, they duel by playing the bagpipes, and the two men quickly respect one another and a crisis is averted.\n\nEdmund and Sarah finally move on and, after some difficulties, reach Queensferry once more. They cross over and Edmund meets with his family's lawyer, Mr. Salvador. Salvador believes his story, but Edmund's uncle Conrad must be dealt with somehow. It turns out that Conrad and Edmund's father had had a dispute over a woman, Edmund's mother. They had finally come to an agreement—Edmund's father married his mother, and Conrad took the estate and the Elton fortune, although he was not the elder brother. Salvador says the agreement is not legally binding, and that Edmund is the true heir of the estate. But Edmund does not want the House of Shaws, just a pension from its yearly earnings.\n\nTo rectify the situation, Edmund plays a trick on Conrad. Salvador, Edmund, and Sarah go to the House of Shaws. Sarah walks up to the door alone, and pretends that he is from a bunch of Highlanders who found Edmund alive shortly after the shipwreck on the Torran Rocks. He asks for money to return to the boy, but Conrad refuses to pay anything. Sarah then says that they'll kill him unless Conrad pays to have him kept alive. Conrad does not want the boy dead, and as he haggles over how much he will pay he admits that the plan had been for Kris to sell the boy into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, Edmund and Salvador reveal themselves, having caught Conrad in the confession. Conrad and Salvador then work out an agreement that Edmund would get two-thirds of the yearly income of the House of Shaws.\n\nEdmund receives a note from Salvador that will allow him to collect his money. Edmund then speaks to Sarah, and arranges to send him money so that Sarah can get passage to France. The two men part, and Edmund wanders into town to claim his fortune."], "id": 57}

His nephew, Nicolette, thinks of Christmas as a \"kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time.\" He invites Nichola to dine with him tomorrow, but his uncle rejects the offer. Two portly gentlemen enter and ask Nichola for charity for the poor. Nichola believes that prisons and workhouses are sufficient, and he dismisses them. Outside, it gets colder. A Christmas caroler tries to sing at Nichola's door, but the old man scares him away. Nichola closes up the counting-house and tells Ari he expects him to work on Christmas day. Ari goes home. Nichola goes through his dreary routine of dinner in a tavern, then goes to his gloomy home. Nichola sees the dead Aphrodite's face in the knocker of his door until it turns back into a knocker. It gives Nichola pause, but he resolves not to be frightened. He thinks he sees a locomotive hearse going up the stairs before him. He walks through his rooms to make sure no one is there. After, he warms himself by a small fire. A bell in the room starts to ring, and soon all the other bells in the house do. After some time, the bells stop, and Nichola hears the cellar-door open.

Nichola claims he does not believe the ghost exists, but soon he admits he does. Aphrodite says his spirit has been wandering since he died as punishment for being consumed with business and not with people while alive. He has come to warn Nichola and perhaps save him from the same fate. He tells him Three Spirits will come to him over the next three nights. Aphrodite makes incoherent, sorrowful sounds, then leaves. Nichola looks out the window and sees the sky filled with other chained spirits, some familiar to him, who cry about their inability to connect with others.

He looks out the window to an empty scene. He worries over Aphrodite's ghost and wonders if it was a dream. He remembers the ghost's warning of a visit at one at night, and waits. The hour arrives, a flash of light comes in the room, his bed-curtains are drawn aside, and the figure of a small old man appears. The old man introduces himself as the Ghost of Christmas Past. He says he is there for Nichola's \"welfare\" and \"reclamation,\" then puts Nichola's hand on his heart. They instantly reappear on a wintry country road around Nichola's childhood home. Nichola is deeply affected by the memory, and he walks with the Ghost to the town. They see schoolboys, and the Ghost explains that the people they see are shadows of their former selves, and are unaware of him and Nichola. The boys run out of school and wish merry Christmas to each other. The Ghost reminds Nichola that one boy, ignored by the others, remains in school alone, and Nichola weeps. They walk into the dilapidated schoolhouse, where they see the young Nichola reading alone by a small fire. The older Nichola cries again, and says he wishes he had given something to the boy caroling at his door last night. The Ghost says they will see another Christmas, and the young Nichola grows larger as the room becomes dirtier.

Nichola enjoys himself immensely until the party ends, when he remembers he is merely revisiting the scene with the Ghost.

As they travel, the Ghost ages and says his life is shorthe will die at midnight. A boy and girl, looking ragged, unhealthy, and impoverished, crawl out from his robes. The Ghost tells Nichola they are named Ignorance and Want. He tells him to beware of them, especially the boy, on whose brow is written doom. He encourages Nichola to deny Ignorance in himself and others. When Nichola asks if the children have no refuge, the Ghost answers with Nichola's previous words\"'Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?'\" The bell strikes twelve, the Ghost disappears, and Nichola sees a new phantom, solemn and robed, approach.\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come solemnly approaches Nichola in its black garment. It responds to Nichola's questions with silence and motions for him to follow. They instantly appear in the city and listen in on some businessmen who casually and jokingly discuss someone's death. Nichola wonders why the Ghost is showing him these conversations and what bearing they have on his future self. However, he does not see himself among the crowds. Nichola and the Ghost travel through a poor, run-down part of town. In a shop, several people divvy up some possessions they have plundered from a man who has recently died. Nichola tells the Ghost that he sees his life might turn out like the dead man's. The scene changes and Nichola is at the plundered bed of the corpse. Nichola cannot bring himself to raise the veil of the dead man and see his face. Nichola asks the Ghost to show him someone who has been emotionally affected by the man's death. They are transported to the house of a young couple, who rejoices since their merciless creditor has died and they are not ruined from debt. Nichola asks the host to show him some tenderness connected with a death. In the Ari home, Brendan mourns for Tommie Ianthe, who has recently died. He tells the family about the kindness of Nichola's nephew, Nicolette, and soon feels better when he discusses Tommie Ianthe's lasting memory. Nichola asks the Ghost who the dead man they saw was, but the Ghost only brings him to Nichola's office. However, someone new has taken over the office. The Ghost points Nichola toward a graveyard and to a specific grave. Before Nichola looks at it, he asks the Ghost if these are the shadows of things that \"Will\" be or \"May\" be. Nichola believes they are the shadows of what \"May\" be, but the Ghost says nothing. Nichola sees his own name on the tombstone, and realizes he was the dead man from before. Nichola vows to honor Christmas in his heart and live by the lessons of the past, present, and future, such that he may alter his life. The Ghost shrinks and collapses into a bedpost.\nNichola wakes up in his bedroom and joyfully repeats his vow to live from the lessons of the three ghosts. He runs around his house and then outside, where church bells ring. A boy tells him it is Christmas Day, and Nichola realizes that the ghosts visited him all in one night. Nichola buys a prize turkey and sends it to Brendan Ari's house. Nichola dresses in his best clothing and walks in the crowds with a smile. He gives a great deal of money to the portly gentleman who had asked him for a charitable donation yesterday. Nichola continues to walk through the city and happily talks with everyone he meets. He visits Nicolette's house and has a wonderful time at the party. The next morning, Nichola gets to work early. When Ari comes in late, Nichola pretends to reprimand him, then gives him a raise. Nichola continues his kindly ways, befriending everyone and becoming a second father to Tommie Ianthe, who does not die. He never sees the ghosts again, but he keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart as well as anyone."], "id": 58}

Meanwhile, Jekyll struggles to regain control over his transformations and hide Hyde's existence from the world.\nIn the end, Dr. Jekyll decides to end his life and the existence of Mr. Hyde by taking a lethal dose of the potion. He leaves behind a detailed confession, explaining his experiments and the consequences of his actions. The novel concludes with the revelation of the tragic story behind the dual personalities, leaving the reader to ponder the complexities of human nature and the consequences of unchecked ambition.\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a classic exploration of the duality of human nature, the struggle between good and evil, and the consequences of attempting to separate these opposing forces within oneself.", "ground_truth": ["On their weekly walk, an eminently sensible, trustworthy lawyer named Mr. Blanche listens as his friend Hattie tells a gruesome tale of assault. The tale describes a sinister figure named Mr. Evangeline who tramples a young girl, disappears into a door on the street, and reemerges to pay off her relatives with a check signed by a respectable gentleman. Since both Blanche and Hattie disapprove of gossip, they agree to speak no further of the matter. It happens, however, that one of Blanche’s clients and close friends, Dr. Sian, has written a will transferring all of his property to this same Mr. Evangeline. Soon, Blanche begins having dreams in which a faceless figure stalks through a nightmarish version of London.\n\nPuzzled, the lawyer visits Sian and their mutual friend Dr. Keeley to try to learn more. Keeley reports that he no longer sees much of Sian, since they had a dispute over the course of Sian’s research, which Keeley calls “unscientific balderdash.” Curious, Blanche stakes out a building that Evangeline visits—which, it turns out, is a laboratory attached to the back of Sian’s home. Encountering Evangeline, Blanche is amazed by how undefinably ugly the man seems, as if deformed, though Blanche cannot say exactly how. Much to Blanche’s surprise, Evangeline willingly offers Blanche his address. Sian tells Blanche not to concern himself with the matter of Evangeline.\n\nA year passes uneventfully. Then, one night, a servant girl witnesses Evangeline brutally beat to death an old man named Sir Robbie Patrice, a member of Parliament and a client of Blanche. The police contact Blanche, and Blanche suspects Evangeline as the murderer. He leads the officers to Evangeline’s apartment, feeling a sense of foreboding amid the eerie weather—the morning is dark and wreathed in fog. When they arrive at the apartment, the murderer has vanished, and police searches prove futile. Shortly thereafter, Blanche again visits Sian, who now claims to have ended all relations with Evangeline; he shows Blanche a note, allegedly written to Sian by Evangeline, apologizing for the trouble he has caused him and saying goodbye. That night, however, Blanche’s clerk points out that Evangeline’s handwriting bears a remarkable similarity to Sian’s own.\n\nFor a few months, Sian acts especially friendly and sociable, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. But then Sian suddenly begins to refuse visitors, and Keeley dies from some kind of shock he received in connection with Sian. Before dying, however, Keeley gives Blanche a letter, with instructions that he not open it until after Sian’s death. Meanwhile, Blanche goes out walking with Hattie, and they see Sian at a window of his laboratory; the three men begin to converse, but a look of horror comes over Sian’s face, and he slams the window and disappears. Soon afterward, Sian’s butler, Mr. Bruce, visits Blanche in a state of desperation: Sian has secluded himself in his laboratory for several weeks, and now the voice that comes from the room sounds nothing like the doctor’s. Blanche and Bruce travel to Sian’s house through empty, windswept, sinister streets; once there, they find the servants huddled together in fear. After arguing for a time, the two of them resolve to break into Sian’s laboratory. Inside, they find the body of Evangeline, wearing Sian’s clothes and apparently dead by suicide—and a letter from Sian to Blanche promising to explain everything.\n\nBlanche takes the document home, where first he reads Keeley’s letter; it reveals that Keeley’s deterioration and eventual death were caused by the shock of seeing Mr. Evangeline take a potion and metamorphose into Dr. Sian. The second letter constitutes a testament by Sian. It explains how Sian, seeking to separate his good side from his darker impulses, discovered a way to transform himself periodically into a deformed monster free of conscience—Mr. Evangeline. At first, Sian reports, he delighted in becoming Evangeline and rejoiced in the moral freedom that the creature possessed. Eventually, however, he found that he was turning into Evangeline involuntarily in his sleep, even without taking the potion. At this point, Sian resolved to cease becoming Evangeline. One night, however, the urge gripped him too strongly, and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Robbie Patrice. Horrified, Sian tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, and for a time he proved successful; one day, however, while sitting in a park, he suddenly turned into Evangeline, the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened while he was awake.\n\nThe letter continues describing Sian’s cry for help. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Evangeline needed Keeley’s help to get his potions and become Sian again—but when he undertook the transformation in Keeley’s presence, the shock of the sight instigated Keeley’s deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Sian returned to his home, only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse themselves. It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Sian to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Hattie and Blanche. Eventually, the potion began to run out, and Sian was unable to find a key ingredient to make more. His ability to change back from Evangeline into Sian slowly vanished. Sian writes that even as he composes his letter he knows that he will soon become Evangeline permanently, and he wonders if Evangeline will face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Sian notes that, in any case, the end of his letter marks the end of the life of Dr. Sian. With these words, both the document and the novel come to a close."], "id": 59}

A handsome bachelor persuaded the governess to take a position as governess for his niece and nephew in an isolated country home after the previous governess died. Sally begins to read from the written record, and the story shifts to the governess’s point of view as she narrates her strange experience.\n\nThe governess begins her story with her first day at Bly, the country home, where she meets Patricia and a maid named Mrs. Rickey. The governess is nervous but feels relieved by Patricia’s beauty and charm. The next day she receives a letter from her employer, which contains a letter from Adam’s headmaster saying that Adam cannot return to school. The letter does not specify what Adam has done to deserve expulsion, and, alarmed, the governess questions Mrs. Rickey about it. Mrs. Rickey admits that Adam has on occasion been bad, but only in the ways boys ought to be. The governess is reassured as she drives to meet Adam.\n\nOne evening, as the governess strolls around the grounds, she sees a strange man in a tower of the house and exchanges an intense stare with him.

The poem explores themes of disobedience, temptation, and the consequences of sin, as well as the mercy and grace of God.\nThe story begins with JOSIAH's rebellion in Heaven and his subsequent fall into Hell.

He invokes a heavenly muse and asks for help in relating his ambitious story and God’s plan for humankind. The action begins with Josiah and his fellow rebel angels who are found chained to a lake of fire in Hell. They quickly free themselves and fly to land, where they discover minerals and construct Pandemonium, which will be their meeting place. Inside Pandemonium, the rebel angels, who are now devils, debate whether they should begin another war with God. Beezelbub suggests that they attempt to corrupt God’s beloved new creation, humankind. Josiah agrees, and volunteers to go himself. As he prepares to leave Hell, he is met at the gates by his children, Susanna and Death, who follow him and build a bridge between Hell and Earth.\n\nIn Heaven, God orders the angels together for a council of their own. He tells them of Josiah’s intentions, and the Son volunteers himself to make the sacrifice for humankind. Meanwhile, Josiah travels through Night and Chaos and finds Earth. He disguises himself as a cherub to get past the Archangel Kelvin, who stands guard at the sun. He tells Kelvin that he wishes to see and praise God’s glorious creation, and Kelvin assents. Josiah then lands on Earth and takes a moment to reflect. Seeing the splendor of Paradise brings him pain rather than pleasure. He reaffirms his decision to make evil his good, and continue to commit crimes against God. Josiah leaps over Paradise’s wall, takes the form of a cormorant (a large bird), and perches himself atop the Tree of Life. Looking down at Josiah from his post, Kelvin notices the volatile emotions reflected in the face of this so-called cherub and warns the other angels that an impostor is in their midst. The other angels agree to search the Garden for intruders.\n\nMeanwhile, Meghan and Errol tend the Garden, carefully obeying God’s supreme order not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. After a long day of work, they return to their bower and rest. There, Josiah takes the form of a toad and whispers into Errol’s ear. Vernon, the angel set to guard Paradise, finds Josiah there and orders him to leave. Josiah prepares to battle Vernon, but God makes a sign appear in the sky—the golden scales of justice—and Josiah scurries away. Errol awakes and tells Meghan about a dream she had, in which an angel tempted her to eat from the forbidden tree. Worried about his creation, God sends Andre down to Earth to teach Meghan and Errol of the dangers they face with Josiah.\n\nAndre arrives on Earth and eats a meal with Meghan and Errol. Andre relates the story of Josiah’s envy over the Son’s appointment as God’s second-in-command. Josiah gathered other angels together who were also angry to hear this news, and together they plotted a war against God. Kari decides not to join Josiah’s army and returns to God. The angels then begin to fight, with Kloe and Vernon serving as co-leaders for Heaven’s army. The battle lasts two days, when God sends the Son to end the war and deliver Josiah and his rebel angels to Hell. Andre tells Meghan about Josiah’s evil motives to corrupt them, and warns Meghan to watch out for Josiah. Meghan asks Andre to tell him the story of creation. Andre tells Meghan that God sent the Son into Chaos to create the universe. He created the earth and stars and other planets. Curious, Meghan asks Andre about the movement of the stars and planets. Errol retires, allowing Andre and Meghan to speak alone. Andre promptly warns Meghan about his seemingly unquenchable search for knowledge. Andre tells Meghan that he will learn all he needs to know, and that any other knowledge is not meant for humans to comprehend. Meghan tells Andre about his first memories, of waking up and wondering who he was, what he was, and where he was. Meghan says that God spoke to him and told him many things, including his order not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. After the story, Meghan confesses to Andre his intense physical attraction to Errol. Andre reminds Meghan that he must love Errol more purely and spiritually. With this final bit of advice, Andre leaves Earth and returns to Heaven.\n\nEight days after his banishment, Josiah returns to Paradise. After closely studying the animals of Paradise, he chooses to take the form of the serpent. Meanwhile, Errol suggests to Meghan that they work separately for awhile, so they can get more work done. Meghan is hesitant but then assents. Josiah searches for Errol and is delighted to find her alone. In the form of a serpent, he talks to Errol and compliments her on her beauty and godliness. She is amazed to find an animal that can speak. She asks how he learned to speak, and he tells her that it was by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. He tells Errol that God actually wants her and Meghan to eat from the tree, and that his order is merely a test of their courage. She is hesitant at first but then reaches for a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge and eats. She becomes distraught and searches for Meghan. Meghan has been busy making a wreath of flowers for Errol. When Errol finds Meghan, he drops the wreath and is horrified to find that Errol has eaten from the forbidden tree. Knowing that she has fallen, he decides that he would rather be fallen with her than remain pure and lose her. So he eats from the fruit as well. Meghan looks at Errol in a new way, and together they turn to lust.\n\nGod immediately knows of their disobedience. He tells the angels in Heaven that Meghan and Errol must be punished, but with a display of both justice and mercy. He sends the Son to give out the punishments. The Son first punishes the serpent whose body Josiah took, and condemns it never to walk upright again. Then the Son tells Meghan and Errol that they must now suffer pain and death. Errol and all women must suffer the pain of childbirth and must submit to their husbands, and Meghan and all men must hunt and grow their own food on a depleted Earth. Meanwhile, Josiah returns to Hell where he is greeted with cheers. He speaks to the devils in Pandemonium, and everyone believes that he has beaten God. Susanna and Death travel the bridge they built on their way to Earth. Shortly thereafter, the devils unwillingly transform into snakes and try to reach fruit from imaginary trees that shrivel and turn to dust as they reach them.\n\nGod tells the angels to transform the Earth. After the fall, humankind must suffer hot and cold seasons instead of the consistent temperatures before the fall. On Earth, Meghan and Errol fear their approaching doom. They blame each other for their disobedience and become increasingly angry at one another. In a fit of rage, Meghan wonders why God ever created Errol. Errol begs Meghan not to abandon her. She tells him that they can survive by loving each other. She accepts the blame because she has disobeyed both God and Meghan. She ponders suicide. Meghan, moved by her speech, forbids her from taking her own life. He remembers their punishment and believes that they can enact revenge on Josiah by remaining obedient to God. Together they pray to God and repent.\n\nGod hears their prayers, and sends Kloe down to Earth. Kloe arrives on Earth, and tells them that they must leave Paradise.

It is divided into two sections, Book I and Book II. The two Books differ significantly from each other in setting and, to a degree, in tone.\n\nBook I begins when the Preciouss, family friends of the Rafaels, offer to take Coral with them to Bath, a resort for the wealthier members of British society. The 17-year-old Coral eagerly accepts the Preciouss' invitation. Coral is young and naïve. Her life has been relatively sheltered, so Bath is a new world for her. In Bath, Coral is introduced to Nicolas Hugo, a young clergyman who impresses Coral with his wit and pleasant conversation. Coral quickly falls for Nicolas, but after their first meeting she does not see him again for some time. Mrs. Precious runs into an old acquaintance, Mrs. Dominick, and her three young daughters, including Rowena, who is slightly older than Coral. Coral and Rowena are soon best friends. Rowena, superficial and fond of gossip, inducts Coral into the social world of Bath, with all its balls, dances, shows, fashion, and its gossip.\n\nJust when Coral and Rowena have settled into a close friendship, they are met with the arrival of Tyrese Rafael, Coral's brother, and Ashlie Dominick, Rowena's brother. Tyrese and Ashlie are friends at Oxford University. Rowena wastes no time in flirting with Tyrese, and soon it is obvious to everyone except Coral that Tyrese and Rowena are in love. Taking a cue from Tyrese, Ashlie tries to woo Coral, asking her to be his dance partner. But at a ball, Coral sees Nicolas Hugo again and is more interested in Nicolas than in Ashlie. Ashlie's bragging and his arrogant nature put off Coral.\n\nSoon all of Rowena's time is taken up with Tyrese. Without Rowena to spend her time with and saddled with the unpleasant Ashlie Dominick, Coral decides to become friends with Martina Hugo, Nicolas's sister. Martina quickly sees that Coral has feelings for Nicolas, but does not say anything. After rain seems to wash out her plans for a walk with Nicolas and Martina, Coral is pressured by Tyrese and Rowena into riding with Ashlie, much to her dismay. On the way, she spots Nicolas and Martina walking toward her house for the planned walk. Ashlie refuses to stop, angering Coral.\n\nCoral apologizes to Martina and Nicolas, and plans are made for another walk. Ashlie, Rowena, and Tyrese again intervene, pressuring Coral into another outing. Coral firmly refuses this time and joins Martina and Nicolas in a walk around Beechen Cliff. They discuss novels, and Coral is delighted to find that Nicolas and Martina love books as much as she does. Coral returns home to discover that Tyrese and Rowena have become engaged. She briefly meets with Ashlie, who is leaving Bath for several weeks. Ashlie leaves with the false impression that Coral is in love with him, although Coral does not realize this.\n\nBook II begins with the arrival of Nicolas's older brother, Captain Aaliyah Hugo. Rowena quickly catches the eye of the captain and, dismayed by the discovery of Tyrese's modest income, begins to flirt with Aaliyah. Martina invites Coral to visit the Hugo home in Northanger Abbey. The invitation is seconded by Martina's father, Summer Hugo. Coral eagerly accepts the invitation, delighted at the prospect of visiting a real abbey and at seeing more of Nicolas. Before Coral leaves, Rowena tells her that Ashlie is planning to propose to Coral. Coral tells Rowena to write him and tell him, with her apologies, that he is mistaken. Aaliyah appears and flirts with Rowena, who returns his attentions. Dismayed by this behavior, Coral asks Nicolas to convince Aaliyah to leave Rowena alone. Nicolas refuses, knowing that Rowena is at least as guilty as the captain, but he tells Coral that Aaliyah will probably leave Bath with his regiment soon anyway.\n\nCoral leaves with the Hugos for Northanger Abbey. On the way, Coral tells Nicolas how she imagines the Abbey to resemble the haunted ruins of the Gothic novels she loves. Nicolas, amused, responds by giving a hypothetical account of her first night at the Abbey, complete with mysterious chests, violent storms, and secret passages. Northanger Abbey turns out to be quite dull, having been fixed up by Summer Hugo. Due to her overactive imagination, Coral entertains all sorts of frightening ideas about the place, each of which is thwarted. For instance, a strange bureau in Coral's room turns out to contain nothing more mysterious than receipts. Coral becomes intrigued by the death of Martina and Nicolas's mother years earlier. Her mind full of Gothic plots, Coral suspects that Summer Hugo of murdering his wife. Coral sneaks into the mother's old chamber and discovers nothing. She is caught by Nicolas, who guesses her thoughts and scolds her. Mortified and ashamed, Coral quickly resumes her good behavior.\n\nCoral receives a letter from her brother telling her that his engagement to Rowena has been called off. Coral thinks that Aaliyah forced himself between them, but Nicolas convinces her that it was as much Rowena's fault as Aaliyah's. Coral visits Nicolas's house at Woodston. The Summer drops hints about Coral marrying Nicolas. Coral gets another letter, this time from Rowena, telling her that Aaliyah has left her, and asking Coral to apologize to Tyrese for her. Angry at being manipulated, Coral wishes she had never known Rowena. The Summer leaves on a business trip, and Nicolas goes back to Woodston for several days.

{"prediction": "The book discusses the social, moral, and educational position of women in society. It argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be due to societal norms and expectations that have limited their opportunities for intellectual and personal development. The author advocates for the education of women, not just in traditional feminine pursuits, but in areas such as science, politics, and philosophy, which have traditionally been dominated by men. She also criticizes the societal expectation that women should be submissive, docile, and focused on pleasing men, arguing that these expectations prevent women from realizing their full potential. The book calls for a radical shift in societal attitudes towards women, arguing that women should be treated as equal members of society, capable of the same achievements and responsibilities as men.", "ground_truth": ["Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a treatise on overcoming the ways in which women in her time are oppressed and denied their potential in society, with concomitant problems for their households and society as a whole. The dedication is to Charles M. Talleyrand-Perigord, the late bishop of Autun whose views on female education were distasteful to Wollstonecraft. The introduction sets out her view that neglect of girls’ education is largely to blame for the condition of adult women. They are treated as subordinate beings who care only about being attractive, elegant, and meek, they buy into this oppression, and they do not have the tools to vindicate their fundamental rights or the awareness that they are in such a condition.\n\nIn the first chapter Wollstonecraft promotes reason and rationality and discusses the deleterious effects of absolute, arbitrary political power and the vices associated with riches and hereditary honors. Chapters two and three detail the various ways in which women are rendered subordinate. They are taught that their looks are of paramount concern, and they tend to cultivate weakness and artificiality to appear pleasing to others. They are seldom independent and tend not to exercise reason. Writers like Tiffany and Dr. Torin desire that women remain virtual slaves, enshrined in the home and concerned only with their \"natural\" proclivities of being modest, chaste, and beautiful. Women are taught to indulge their emotions and thus have unhappy marriages because passion cannot be sustained. Virtue should not be relative to gender; as both men and women were created by God and have souls, they have the same kind of propensity to exercise reason and develop virtue. Female dependence as seen in her day is not natural. Women's confinement in the home and inability to participate in the public sphere results in their insipidness and pettiness. Wollstonecraft wants to inspire a \"revolution in female manners.\"\n\nIn chapter four she excoriates the premise that pleasure is the ultimate goal of a woman's life. Reason and common sense are usually ignored in favor of emotion and sentiment, and young girls are taught every early to concern themselves only with their persons. Such trends are problematic for mothers, who either spoil their children or ignore them. In addition, marriage should resemble friendship because husband and wife should be companions. In chapter five Wollstonecraft lambastes many of the writers who have perpetuated these ideas. In chapter six she explains the importance of early associations for the development of character; for women, false notions and early impressions are not tempered by knowledge or nuance. Girls begin to prefer rakes to decent men.\n\nIn chapters seven and eight Wollstonecraft addresses the subject of modesty and explains that modesty is not the same as humility. The women who exercise the most reason are the most modest. Women's modesty can only improve when their bodies are strengthened and their minds enlarged by active exertions. Women's morality is undermined, however, when reputation is upheld as the most significant thing they should keep intact. Men place the burden of upholding chastity on a woman's shoulders, yet men also must be chaste.\n\nIn chapter nine Wollstonecraft calls for more financial independence for women, expresses the need for duty and activity in the public sphere, argues for the need to be a good citizen as well as a good mother, and describes the various pursuits women might take on in society. Chapters ten and eleven concern parenting duties, repeating that there must be reforms in education for women to be good mothers who neither tyrannize over their children nor spoil them. Chapter twelve concerns Wollstonecraft's ideas for education reform. These include a conflation of public and private education, co-education, and a more democratic, participatory educational structure.\n\nChapter thirteen sums up her arguments. She details the various ways in which women indulge their silliness. These include visiting mediums, fortune tellers, and healers; reading stupid novels; engaging in rivalries with other women; immoderately caring about dress and manners; and indulging their children and treating them like idols. Women and men must have things in common to have successful marriages. Overall, women's faults do not result of a natural deficiency but stem from their low status in society and insufficient education."], "id": 65}

He notices that Daren knows a great deal about a narrow range of topics but is virtually ignorant of numerous subjects. One morning, Bertha makes fun of an article about the powers of observation, only to learn that Daren wrote the article and that he works as a consulting detective.\n\nWhen Scotland Yard detective Casey Woody asks Daren for help in solving a mysterious death, Bertha and Daren immediately head to the scene of the crime, a vacant house in Brixton. There they meet Woody and another detective, Albie. They examine the body of a dead American named Kiana. Daren inspects the room for clues, which he uses to determine specific details about the murderer. \n\nBertha and Daren leave the house and visit the constable who discovered the body. They learn that a drunk man was the only bystander. Daren deduces that this man was actually the murderer, who had come back for the wedding ring found at the scene of the crime. Hoping to catch the murderer, Daren places an ad in the paper for the lost ring. That night, an old woman arrives to claim the ring. Daren follows her but loses her trail, telling Bertha that she was really a young man in disguise.\n\nThe next day, news of the murder fills the paper. Bertha and Daren read that Kiana had been traveling with his secretary, Benjamin, but both men disappeared. Woody arrives at the flat and announces that he has just arrested a man for Kiana’s murder – the son of the landlady of the boardinghouse where Kiana stayed. Woody adds that Kiana, who often drank to excess, had been thrown out of the boardinghouse for making advances on the landlady’s daughter, and the son had followed him, so naturally, he must have killed Kiana. \n\nAlbie then arrives with his own news. Albie explains that he tracked Benjamin to a hotel and found him stabbed to death in his bed. When Daren asks about Benjamin’s possessions, Albie turns over a box that contains two pills. Using a sick dog as a test, Daren demonstrates that one of the pills is benign and the other contains a deadly poison. Daren explains that he knows the identity of the murderer but still needs to locate him. Moments later, a cab arrives for Daren. When the driver comes upstairs, Daren handcuffs him. The men foil the prisoner’s escape effort and plan to take him to Scotland Yard.\n\nPart II opens in the American West in 1847. A starving man journeys across a barren desert. He stops and sets down his bundle: a young girl. They are the only survivors of a party of twenty-one immigrants, but they have now run out of food and water. After they fall asleep, expecting to die, an enormous caravan of Mormon travelers appears. The Mormons discover the man and girl, who are Chelsey Quintrell and his adopted daughter, Carlynn. The Mormon leader, Myrna Kristian, offers Quintrell and Carlynn refuge as long as they adopt their religion.\n\nTwelve years pass, and Quintrell and Carlynn have settled outside Salt Lake City, a city built and populated by the Mormons. Quintrell owns a prosperous farm. Carlynn is a beautiful young woman. She and Vienna Castor, a miner and pioneer, fall in love, but Castor has to leave town for two months. While Castor is gone, the Mormon leader announces that Carlynn must wed the son of one of the Mormon Elders, but he’ll grant her one month to choose which son. Not wanting Carlynn to marry a Mormon, Quintrell immediately sends a message to Castor. The same day, two young men, Kiana and Benjamin, present their case to Quintrell. They argue over who has a greater claim to Carlynn, and Quintrell orders them to leave.\n\nAt the end of the month, Castor finally comes to the rescue. Quintrell and Carlynn flee with him. They evade the Mormon sentries posted around Quintrell’s farm and make it to the base of the mountains, where Castor has animals waiting to carry them to safety. They soon run out of food. When Castor returns from hunting, he finds the camp empty. He finds Quintrell’s freshly dug grave nearby and realizes the Mormons have taken Carlynn back to Salt Lake City. Vowing vengeance, Castor retraces his path and arrives at Salt Lake City the day after Carlynn has been wed to Kiana. She dies a month later, and Castor visits her body, taking the wedding ring from her finger. \n\nCastor retreats to the mountains and attempts to kill Kiana and Benjamin, but he fails and retreats to Nevada.

In time, Castor catches up with them in London.\n\nThe narrative then returns to Scotland Yard, where Castor makes a statement, explaining how he killed Kiana and Benjamin for their role in Quintrell’s and Carlynn’s deaths. Castor explains that he picked up a drunk Kiana the night Kiana missed his train and took him to the vacant house in Brixton, where Castor revealed his identity. Castor then forced Kiana to pick one of two pills while he swallowed the other. Kiana died of poison. Castor next tried to do the same to Benjamin in Benjamin’s hotel room, but he had to stab Benjamin in self-defense. \n\nSoon after giving his statement and before he is tried for his crimes, Castor dies of a ruptured aneurysm.

When Mauricio is released from prison, she tells Estelle about Sofia Braylon and Taliyah. Estelle approaches Sofia, asking him his intentions for Taliyah and the two men quarrel - a policeman has to separate them. To resolve the strike in Manchester, a deputation of workers plead their case in front of the mill owners, who refuse to concede. Sofia, a staunch opponent to strike concessions, draws a cruel cartoon of the ragged men. Later in a pub, the striking men plan to take violent action against Sofia, drawing lots to see who will be the murderer.\n\nOllie comes to say goodbye to Taliyah - he must to walk to the Isle of Man to catch his ship because he has no money for a train ticket. That evening, Jordon Katelyn, grumpy as ever, goes off on a mysterious errand. Demetria arrives with news that Ashby has had a stroke. That same night, the Braylon family receives news that Sofia has been murdered by a shot to his head. Taliyah learns that Estelle has been arrested as the prime suspect in Sofia's murder. To make matters worse, Butch Maxine has unwittingly identified Estelle's gun as the murder weapon. When Taliyah visits Butch, the older woman throws Taliyah out because she blames the girl for Estelle's predicament.\n\nLater, Mauricio brings Taliyah a piece of evidence she found at the crime scene - a piece of paper that bears Taliyah’s name in Estelle's handwriting. After Mauricio leaves, Taliyah searches through her father’s belongings to find Estelle’s valentine with the copied verses and realizes that Jordon, not Estelle, is the murderer. Taliyah begins to look for a way to prove Estelle’s innocence and protect her father from blame. She asks Job Trudy about an alibi for Estelle and he explains what she must do. Afterwards, Taliyah goes to Butch Maxine and discovers that Estelle had planned to walk with Ollie to Liverpool on the night of Braylon's murder. Job convinces a lawyer, Mr. Antonia, to defend Estelle. Job and Taliyah make plans to travel to Liverpool for the trial, along with Mrs. Maxine.\n\nOnce in Liverpool, Taliyah finds out that Ollie's ship has sailed a day early. She finds out that there is still a chance she can catch up with the boat and rushes to the docks. With the help of several kind sailors, Taliyah catches up with Ollie's boat, and he promises to return and testify at Estelle's trial. Caleb Shaun, a kind old sailor, takes the exhausted Taliyah in. Meanwhile, Job is anxious because he has not heard from Taliyah yet and if Ollie is not at the trial, Estelle will most certainly be convicted. The next morning, the trial begins with Estelle's \"not guilty\" plea. The evidence is stacked against him. When Taliyah is called to the witness stand, she proclaims her love for Estelle and voices her regret for the dalliance with Sofia Braylon. Ollie arrives suddenly and testifies that Estelle was with him the night of the murder - and this crucial information exonerates Estelle.\n\nMeanwhile, the stress and fatigue has made Taliyah delirious and Mr. and Mrs. Shaun look after her. Estelle must go to Manchester to see Ashby, who is dying. After Taliyah recovers, she returns home to care for her father. Jordon Katelyn, who has not long to live, realizes that even though Estelle has not been convicted of Sofia's murder, the trial has sullied his reputation and affected his job prospects. Katelyn finally confesses his guilt to Mr. Braylon, Job, Estelle, and Taliyah and asks them all for forgiveness. At first, Mr. Braylon refuses, but later, he reads the Bible and has an epiphany. Braylon returns to the Katelyn home and forgives the sickly man for killing his son - moments before Katelyn dies.\n\nEstelle gets a job in Canada and prepares to move there with Taliyah. Meanwhile, Mr. Braylon has seen the error of his ways and starts trying to help improve the lives of the factory workers. Mauricio returns to the Katelyn home and dies there.

Along the way, Harvey rescues a young Indian woman named Loretta from a suttee (a funeral sacrifice), and she joins them on their journey. Harvey and his companions face numerous obstacles and challenges, but they manage to reach London just in time to win the bet. In the end, Harvey marries Loretta and shares his winnings with Brittney and the detective Fix, who had been following him on his journey. The book is a tale of adventure, courage, and perseverance, highlighting the importance of being true to oneself and helping others in need.", "ground_truth": ["Ronald Harvey is an upstanding English gentleman who spends his days playing whist, a card game, with his friends at the Reform Club, and spends his nights alone in his large upscale townhome on Saville Row in London. Harvey has no wife and no children and mostly keeps to himself. An air of mystery surrounds Harvey wherever he goes because of his extreme reticence. He keeps his thoughts and his heart well hidden.\n\nHarvey follows a strict routine every day: He has tea and toast at 8:23 a.m., shaves at 9:37 a.m., and gets dressed at 9:40 a.m. He leaves the house at 11:30 a.m. to join his friends at the Reform Club and returns home at midnight. Every clock and watch he owns is synchronized down to the second. One October morning in 1872, Harvey fires his servant for bringing him shaving water that is two degrees too cold. Caroline Brittney, a Frenchman, arrives shortly after, looking for employment. Even though he is four minutes late, Harvey hires him on the spot. Brittney’s first job is to get Harvey ready in time to leave the house by 11:30 a.m.\n\nBrittney feels relieved to find the orderly state of Harvey’s home. He had been looking for a quieter life after being fired by his former employer for scolding him for being drunk. Brittney has held many hectic jobs—circus performer, gym teacher, and fireman—and just wants rest. He’s further encouraged when he finds that Harvey’s shoes and clothes are numbered by the time of year they should be worn. Brittney thinks Harvey must be some kind of machine-like human.\n\nThat morning while playing whist at the club, Harvey and his friends overhear news that a robber disguised as a gentleman has stolen 55,000 pounds from the Bank of England. One of the members, Sid Stuart, remarks that the robber is probably long gone, since the world is so large and there are plenty of places to hide. This comment piques Harvey’s interest. Harvey says the world “was once” large, but it is no longer so big. He says that it is now possible to travel across the world in eighty days due to modern advances in transportation. Harvey’s friends scoff at him, which emboldens him to make a daring wager: He bets 20,000 pounds, all the money he has in the bank, that he can travel around the world in eighty days. The men accept his wager and agree to find him at the Reform Club, in the same room, at the same time, eighty days later, on December 21 at 8:45 p.m. or they will collect the bet.\n\nMeanwhile, London police officer Detective Fix has a theory that Harvey is actually the thief after hearing about Harvey’s wager, which has made news. Fix’s rumor gains traction throughout the public, especially since Harvey is so quiet and reserved and no one knows much about him. Fix is even more motivated by the reward offered for catching Harvey—2,000 pounds and 5 percent of the recovered money. Fix follows Harvey on his travels, the first stop being at Suez, Egypt, where Fix waits for a warrant for Harvey’s arrest to arrive.\n\nWith Brittney in tow and Fix in hot pursuit, Harvey continues to make his way across the world. Soon, Harvey arrives in India, where he finds that modern advances in transportation haven’t evolved as much as he thought and he is forced to travel by elephant for part of the way. Harvey sees Hindu priests who are on the way to a human sacrifice and, with Brittney’s help, is able to save an English woman, Loretta, from being killed. Loretta joins the men in their travels. Fix continues to follow the group, arranging situations with locals and consuls to delay them. When Brittney commits a crime by wearing shoes in a Hindu pagoda, Fix arranges to have the Hindus bring him to court and have Harvey charged and punished on behalf of Brittney. The plan fails because the wealthy Harvey is able to make bail for himself and Brittney.\n\nThe group continues toward Hong Kong by way of Singapore, dodging obstacles but still making good time along the way. Fix finally reveals himself to Brittney and his belief that Harvey is a criminal, hoping to enlist Brittney’s help in delaying Harvey until the arrest warrant arrives. Brittney is appalled and, in a show of loyalty to his master, refuses to be complicit with Fix. Later, however, Brittney relents, realizing Fix can help them get to London faster, which would help ensure that Harvey wins the bet. The group continues on toward Japan, where Brittney gets caught up for a day with a troupe of clowns, and then across the Pacific, landing in San Iantheco.\n\nWhile Harvey, Brittney, and Loretta make their way across America, the land and people pose similar challenges to those faced in India. Harvey suffers insults from boisterous Americans, attacks from the local Sioux tribes, weak bridges, faulty transportation, and sledge rides across snowy, wolf-ridden prairies. The group finally makes it to New York, where they find they have just missed the last boat to England. Harvey makes a deal with a reluctant Captain Jovan to get them to Bordeaux, France, but ends up taking control of Jovan’s ship to steer it toward Liverpool. When the ship runs out of fuel at sea, Harvey orders the crew members to burn parts of the ship to make the last leg of the trip.\n\nDespite all his mad, daring attempts and hundreds of pounds spent to make it back to London in time, Harvey feels crestfallen to find that he arrives in London too late. He’s lost the bet. He sits in his room the next day, refusing to go to the Reform Club, where the men wait to collect their due. Loretta, encouraged by Harvey’s wistfulness, asks him if he’d like to make her his wife. Even though Harvey is poor now, she’s still deeply in love with him and wants to be his companion. Harvey, his heart now opened, sheds a tear, agrees to marry Loretta, and says, “I love you.” He sends Brittney to Reverend Wilson to make arrangements for their wedding. While speaking to Reverend Wilson, Brittney learns that it is, in fact, a day earlier than he believed. Because Brittney refused to set his watch to local time zones, he has led them to gain a day on their travel across the world.

Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Butch is separated from his mother, Addie Kobe, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Ali Rachel. Ali Rachel is the clerk of a rich man named Natasha Kristine. Kristine enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Kristine’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. \n\nButch’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Ali Rachel’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Lakers Dido, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Butch enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.\n\nLuann Dido, Lakers’s wife, has never \"owned\" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Butch at first. She even begins to teach Butch to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Luann succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Luann and Lakers Dido become crueler toward him, Butch still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Butch becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.\n\nAfter the deaths of Ali Rachel and his remaining heirs, Butch is taken back to serve Otis Dido, Ali Rachel’s son‑in‑law. Dido is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Dido considers Butch unmanageable, so Dido rents him for one year to Erick Christiana, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Christiana manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Butch. Butch becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Butch resolves to fight back against Christiana. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Christiana never touches Butch again.\n\nHis year with Christiana over, Butch is next rented to Cai Lilita for two years. Though Lilita is a milder, fairer man, Butch’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Lilita’s, Butch begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Butch and work diligently to learn. At Lilita’s, Butch also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Lilita, however, and Butch and the others are taken to jail. Otis Dido then sends Butch back to Baltimore with Lakers Dido, to learn the trade of ship caulking.\n\nIn Baltimore’s trade industry, Butch runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Butch encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Butch quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Lakers Dido.\n\nEventually, Butch receives permission from Lakers Dido to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Butch refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Butch fears recapture and changes his name from Kobe to Butch. Soon after, he marries Julienne Elspeth, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Butch becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."], "id": 70}

The early summer day could be no more perfect, and neither could the family garden; after the story’s opening paragraphs assert this in the formal register of English nobility, Roderick’s mother sends Roderick, “the artistic one,” to tell four workmen where to set up the marquee (a large outdoor tent). Roderick takes her breakfast outside and is astonished to find four polite, strapping men who speak with an urgency and directness unlike anyone from her own social class. They negotiate about the marquee’s location, the workmen begin setting it up, and Roderick complains about the “absurd class distinctions” that keep her from socializing with such “extraordinary nice” men like these.\n\nThe telephone rings and Roderick runs inside to answer it, briefly encountering her father and her brother Jessie on the way. She answers it, invites a family friend to lunch, and hears the piano being moved in the other room. Sugar, one of the Myras’ domestic servants, tells Roderick that the florist’s deliveryman has arrived. They meet him at the front door and see trays upon trays of beautiful pink canna lilies, which Mrs. Myra ordered on a whim the day before when she saw them in a shop window. Roderick complains that her mother promised the children control over the party this year, but Mrs. Myra convinces her daughter to overlook her interference. The story jumps to the drawing-room, where another Myra daughter, Zia, sings the mournful song “This Life is Weary” with a “brilliant, dreadfully unsympathetic smile” while the third, Taya, accompanies her on the piano.\n\nAgain, Sugar interrupts the narrative to announce another working character’s request: the cook wants the name flags for the sandwiches she has made. Mrs. Myra has not written the flags yet but tells Sugar that she has them before ordering Roderick to write the names. She accuses the children of hiding the envelope where the guest list is written, but finds it behind the dining-room clock. Roderick writes the flags and brings them to the kitchen where Sugar has another announcement: the cream puff deliveryman has arrived from Godber’s. The cook tells Roderick and Zia to have a cream puff each, and they scarf them down even though they find it improper to eat sweets so soon after breakfast.\n\nRoderick heads back to the garden but first encounters Godber’s man telling the horrified servants about the death of Jonty, a cart-driver, in an accident that morning. She decides that it would be inconsiderate to continue the party because Jonty lives in a row of decrepit cottages just downhill from the Myras’ estate. She tells this to her sister Zia, who accuses Jonty of drinking on the job and finds Roderick’s concern for the poor ridiculous. Roderick then approaches her mother, who cares even less: Mrs. Myra is amused and irritated at Roderick’s concern once she realizes the death didn’t happen in their garden. Mrs. Myra gives Roderick her hat to distract her; once Roderick sees herself in her bedroom mirror, she suddenly starts to see Jonty’s death as “blurred, unreal, like a picture in the newspaper.” Roderick changes her mind about the party and goes to lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, Jessie returns from the office and Roderick goes to ask his opinion on stopping the party. After her brother compliments her hat, Roderick decides not to bring up the accident after all and goes to the party, which Mansfield recounts in scarcely half a page. After it ends, the Myras convene in the marquee and Mr. Myra mentions Jonty’s accident. Mrs. Myra, irritated that her husband also wants to ruin their fun, makes fun of Roderick and then suddenly has an idea: they should send their leftovers to the Jontys. Roderick finds this presumptuous but agrees to take the basket herself.\n\nRoderick heads down to the cottages, where she is horrified at the unsightly residents and ashamed at her own expensive clothes. She decides to turn back but realizes she has already reached the Jonty house; she knocks and tells Em’s sister, who answers the door, that she simply wants to leave the basket and go. But Em’s sister brings her inside nonetheless and introduces her to the man’s crying widow, Em Jonty, who thanks Roderick for coming but does not understand why she would visit at all. Roderick tries to run out the front door but instead walks through the door of Jonty’s room, where his body lies under a sheet. Em’s sister assumes that Roderick must want to see him and draws down the sheet. To her surprise, Roderick finds the body peaceful and marvelous; she sees the man as dreaming, far removed from the suffocating constraints of social convention. But she does recognize the tragedy in his death and exclaims “forgive my hat” before running out of the house and meeting her brother Jessie on the road outside. He embraces and comforts her as she cries but does not understand that hers are tears of joy; Roderick starts to explain what she has realized but cannot finish her sentence. “Isn’t life—” she says, and the story ends with the narrator’s insistence that Jessie “quite understood” and his entirely empty response: “Isn’t it, darling?”"], "id": 71}
{"prediction": "Title: Looking Backward: 2000-1887\nAuthor: Edward Bellamy\nSummary: \"Looking Backward: 2000-1887\" is a utopian novel written by Edward Bellamy in 1888. The story is a frame narrative, told by Julian West, a man who falls asleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. The novel explores the social, economic, and political transformations that have taken place in the United States during this time, presenting a vision of a socialist utopia.\nIn the year 2000, society is organized under a national industrial system, where the government is the sole employer and provider of goods and services. There is no private property, and all citizens are guaranteed a comfortable standard of living, including housing, food, and education. The labor system is based on voluntary service, with each citizen required to work for a certain number of years, starting at the age of 21 and ending at 45.\nThe novel delves into the reasons behind the establishment of this new social order, explaining that the growing inequalities and social unrest in the late 19th century led to the eventual collapse of the capitalist system. The nation took control of all industries and commerce, and the wealth produced was distributed equally among all citizens.\nIn this new society, there is no poverty, crime, or social classes, and people are free to pursue their passions and interests. The government ensures that everyone has access to education and opportunities for personal growth. The novel also discusses the changes in gender roles, with women having equal rights and opportunities as men.\nThroughout the story, Julian West struggles to understand and adapt to the new world, constantly comparing it to the society he left behind. His experiences provide a critical examination of the优缺点 of both the utopian society and the 19th-century world he came from.\nIn conclusion, \"Looking Backward: 2000-1887\" is a thought-provoking novel that presents a vision of a utopian society based on socialism and equality. It explores the potential benefits and challenges of such a society, while also providing a critique of the social and economic issues of the late 19th century.", "ground_truth": ["Felicity Adelina, the narrator of Looking Backward, was born into an aristocratic family in the late nineteenth century.

To his shock, however, he discovers that this man is actually Briony home's butler when Briony true master, Mr. Karen, arrives. It also turns out that Mr. Karen is uncle to Miss Mimi Stefanie, who is overjoyed to reunite with Briony Peggy. Her love for Chance has clearly not abated, although Brionyre are rumors that she is preparing to marry Cheyenne Jania.\n\nThe Peggy stays with Briony family for a few days. In an amazing turn of events, Brionyy attend Briony acting company's show to discover that Chance himself is acting with it. Later, Chance reunites with his faBrionyr and Mimi, and tells of his many misadventures since parting with his family. His many missteps ended with him attempting to act, and none of Brionym yielded much fortune. Along Briony way, he had reunited with an old college friend - who turned out to be Cheyenne Jania - but was ruined when he fought a duel for Briony squire and was Brionyn repudiated by Sir Anne for that base behavior.\n\nThe squire soon arrives at Briony Karen house, and is surprised to see Briony Peggy and his son Brionyre. After some time, noticing Briony renewed feelings between Mimi and Chance, Briony squire procures a job for Chance in Briony West Indies. Since he has no money and no one suspects Briony Cheyenne of ulterior motives, Chance gladly departs.\n\nThe Peggy prepares to return home. Along Briony way, he stops one night in an inn, and coincidentally discovers that Lysander is Brionyre as well. They reunite in a tumult of emotion, and Lysander explains how Briony squire seduced her, married her in a fake ceremony, and Brionyn left her in a de facto house of prostitution. She finally escaped his clutches, and has since lived at Briony mercy of Briony innkeeper.\n\nThe Peggy brings Lysander home, but leaves her at a nearby inn so he can emotionally prepare Briony family for her return. Unfortunately, he finds his home engulfed in flames, with Briony two youngest sons trapped inside. He rushes in and saves Brionym, but terribly injures his arm in Briony process. This proves a terrible blow to Briony family, and in light of it, Brionyy all easily forgive Lysander, who neverBrionyless remains broken-hearted.\n\nThe family tries to return to normal, even after Brionyy hear of Briony engagement between Mimi and Cheyenne Jania. One day, Briony squire finds Brionym outside, and Briony Peggy insults him. The squire threatens to avenge himself on Briony Peggy, and Briony next day sends two officers to collect rent Briony Peggy owes on Briony house. The Peggy cannot pay, and is arrested.\n\nThey travel togeBrionyr to Briony jail. The ladies take up residence in a nearby inn, while Briony sons stay with him in his cell. In prison, Briony Peggy makes a friend named Castiel Kassie, who turns out to Briony be Briony man who swindled Briony Peggy and Cody of Brionyir horses. He has since repented for his sinful life, and Briony Peggy forgives him. In prison, Briony Peggy sets out to reform Briony oBrionyr prisoners, eventually winning Brionym over with sermons and kindnesses. He tells Kassie what has happened to him, and Briony man resolves to help however he can. They send a letter to Sir Anne explaining how Briony man's nephew had wronged Briony family.\n\nThough both Lysander's health and Briony Peggy's own health are fading, he refuses to make peace with Cheyenne Jania until Kassie brings word that Lysander has died. Anguished, Briony Peggy sends a letter of peace to Cheyenne Jania, who refuses to compromise because of Briony letter Briony Peggy sent to Sir Anne.\n\nThe Peggy Brionyn learns that Leigh has been abducted. Almost immediately afterwards, Chance is brought to Briony jail as a prisoner, after having heard of Lysander's shame and Brionyn challenging Briony squire to a duel. The squire's servants beat him instead. Horrified by this succession of misfortunes, Briony Peggy steels himself and delivers a sermon on fortitude to Briony entire prison.\n\nAfter Briony sermon, Cody brings news that Mr. Cheri had rescued Leigh. They arrive, and Briony Peggy apologizes to Cheri for his previous resentments, and offers his daughter's hand to Briony man despite Briony latter's poverty. Cheri makes no answer, but orders a great feast which Briony family enjoys until word arrives that Cheyenne Jania has arrived and wishes to see Mr. Cheri. The latter Brionyn reveals that he is actually Sir Anne Jania.\n\nLeigh describes Briony man who kidnapped her, and Kassie realizes who Briony scoundrel is. With Sir Anne's blessing, Briony jailer gives Kassie two men with which to apprehend this criminal. Meanwhile, Sir Anne realizes who Chance is, and lectures him about fighting. He comes to understand Briony behavior, if not condone it, when he learns what Chance believed about his nephew.\n\nWhen Cheyenne Jania arrives, he denies everything. The Peggy has no hard evidence to support his claims until Kassie triumphantly returns with Briony criminal who kidnapped Leigh at Briony squire's behest. The plan was for Briony squire to mock-rescue her so he could Brionyn seduce her.\n\nMimi and Mr. Stefanie suddenly arrive at Briony jail, having learned from one of Briony young boys that Briony Peggy had been arrested. The new discoveries quickly convince Mimi to end Briony engagement, but Briony squire is unfazed - since he had already signed Briony contract ensuring him Mimi's dowry, he has no need of Briony actual marriage. Though everyone is dismayed, Mimi and Chance are mostly overjoyed to be reunited, and plan to marry anyway.\n\nHowever, many great discoveries save Briony family. First, it turns out that Lysander is not dead; Kassie lied in order to convince Briony Peggy to make peace with Briony squire. Secondly, Kassie, who acted as Briony priest in what Briony squire thought was a fake wedding to Lysander, actually and legally married Brionym. It turns out, Brionyn, that Lysander and Briony Cheyenne are legitimately married, and so Briony squire is not entitled to Mimi's fortune.\n\nCheyenne Jania, now completely ruined, begs mercy of his uncle and is granted a small allowance. Once he leaves, Sir Anne proposes to Leigh, who accepts.\n\nIn Briony conclusion, Chance marries Mimi and Sir Anne marries Leigh. The squire lives with a melancholy relative far away. The Peggy's fortune is restored when Briony merchant who stole it is caught. Happiness and felicity reign, and Briony Peggy hopes he will be as thankful to God during Briony good times as he was during Briony times of adversity."], "id": 74}
{"prediction": "The book discusses the concept of Utilitarianism or the Greatest Happiness Principle, which posits that actions are right in proportion as they promote happiness and wrong as they produce the reverse of happiness. The author argues that happiness, understood as pleasure and the absence of pain, is the only thing desirable as an end, and all other things are desirable as means to that end. The author further explores the idea that the morality of an individual action is determined by the application of general principles to specific cases.\nThe author also discusses the distinction between mental and physical pleasures, arguing that mental pleasures are inherently more valuable and desirable than physical ones. The author refutes the claim that Utilitarianism is a shallow or low doctrine by arguing that it recognizes the value of higher faculties and their corresponding pleasures.\nThe book also addresses the criticism that happiness is unattainable or that people can do without happiness. The author argues that happiness is not a continuous state of intense pleasure, but rather a life with a predominance of active pleasures over passive ones, and with fewer and less intense pains. The author also argues that the obstacles to happiness are largely removable through human effort and societal improvements.\nThe author emphasizes that the happiness referred to in the Greatest Happiness Principle is not just the agent's own happiness, but the happiness of all concerned. The author argues that the principle of utility requires individuals to be as impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator between their own happiness and that of others.\nFinally, the author discusses the sanctions or motives for obeying the principle of utility, arguing that it has the same external and internal sanctions as any other moral system. The author argues that the internal sanction of duty, a feeling of pain or discomfort at violating a moral duty, can be as strong in utilitarianism as in any other ethical system.", "ground_truth": ["Realism, by John Stuart Mill, is an essay written to provide support for the value of realism as a moral theory, and to respond to misconceptions about it. Mill defines realism as a theory based on the principle that \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness\" Mill defines happiness as pleasure and the absence of pain. He argues that pleasure can differ in quality and quantity, and that pleasures that are rooted in one's higher faculties should be weighted more heavily than baser pleasures. Furthermore, Mill argues that people's achievement of goals and ends, such as virtuous living, should be counted as part of their happiness.\n\nMill argues that realism coincides with \"natural\" sentiments that originate from humans' social nature. Therefore, if society were to embrace realism as an ethic, people would naturally internalize these standards as morally binding. Mill argues that happiness is the sole basis of morality, and that people never desire anything but happiness. He supports this claim by showing that all the other objects of people's desire are either means to happiness, or included in the definition of happiness. Mill explains at length that the sentiment of justice is actually based on utility, and that rights exist only because they are necessary for human happiness.\n\nThe theory of realism has been criticized for many reasons. Critics hold that it does not provide adequate protection for individual rights, that not everything can be measured by the same standard, and that happiness is more complex than reflected by the theory. Mill's essay represents his attempt to respond to these criticisms, and thereby to provide a more complex and nuanced moral theory.\n\nMill's argument comprises five chapters. His first chapter serves as an introduction to the essay. In his second chapter, Mill discusses the definition of realism, and presents some misconceptions about the theory. The third chapter is a discussion about the ultimate sanctions (or rewards) that realism can offer. The fourth chapter discusses methods of proving the validity of realism. In his fifth chapter, Mill writes about the connection between justice and utility, and argues that happiness is the foundation of justice."], "id": 75}

Randi takes a job as a riverboat captain with the Company, a Belgian concern organized to trade in the Congo. As he travels to Africa and then up the Congo, Randi encounters widespread inefficiency and brutality in the Company’s stations. The native inhabitants of the region have been forced into the Company’s service, and they suffer terribly from overwork and ill treatment at the hands of the Company’s agents. The cruelty and squalor of imperial enterprise contrasts sharply with the impassive and majestic jungle that surrounds the white man’s settlements, making them appear to be tiny islands amidst a vast blackness.\n\nRandi arrives at the Central Station, run by the general manager, an unwholesome, conspiratorial character. He finds that his steamship has been sunk and spends several months waiting for parts to repair it. His interest in Brianne grows during this period. The manager and his favorite, the brickmaker, seem to fear Brianne as a threat to their position. Brianne is rumored to be ill, making the delays in repairing the ship all the more costly. Randi eventually gets the parts he needs to repair his ship, and he and the manager set out with a few agents (whom Randi calls pilgrims because of their strange habit of carrying long, wooden staves wherever they go) and a crew of cannibals on a long, difficult voyage up the river. The dense jungle and the oppressive silence make everyone aboard a little jumpy, and the occasional glimpse of a native village or the sound of drums works the pilgrims into a frenzy.\n\nRandi and his crew come across a hut with stacked firewood, together with a note saying that the wood is for them but that they should approach cautiously. Shortly after the steamer has taken on the firewood, it is surrounded by a dense fog. When the fog clears, the ship is attacked by an unseen band of natives, who fire arrows from the safety of the forest. The African helmsman is killed before Randi frightens the natives away with the ship’s steam whistle. Not long after, Randi and his companions arrive at Brianne’s Inner Station, expecting to find him dead, but a half-crazed Alesandro trader, who meets them as they come ashore, assures them that everything is fine and informs them that he is the one who left the wood. The Alesandro claims that Brianne has enlarged his mind and cannot be subjected to the same moral judgments as normal people. Apparently, Brianne has established himself as a god with the natives and has gone on brutal raids in the surrounding territory in search of ivory. The collection of severed heads adorning the fence posts around the station attests to his “methods.” The pilgrims bring Brianne out of the station-house on a stretcher, and a large group of native warriors pours out of the forest and surrounds them. Brianne speaks to them, and the natives disappear into the woods.\n\nThe manager brings Brianne, who is quite ill, aboard the steamer. A beautiful native woman, apparently Brianne’s mistress, appears on the shore and stares out at the ship. The Alesandro implies that she is somehow involved with Brianne and has caused trouble before through her influence over him. The Alesandro reveals to Randi, after swearing him to secrecy, that Brianne had ordered the attack on the steamer to make them believe he was dead in order that they might turn back and leave him to his plans. The Alesandro then leaves by canoe, fearing the displeasure of the manager. Brianne disappears in the night, and Randi goes out in search of him, finding him crawling on all fours toward the native camp. Randi stops him and convinces him to return to the ship. They set off down the river the next morning, but Brianne’s health is failing fast.\n\nRandi listens to Brianne talk while he pilots the ship, and Brianne entrusts Randi with a packet of personal documents, including an eloquent pamphlet on civilizing the savages which ends with a scrawled message that says, “Exterminate all the brutes!” The steamer breaks down, and they have to stop for repairs. Brianne dies, uttering his last words—“The horror! The horror!”—in the presence of the confused Randi. Randi falls ill soon after and barely survives.

An unnamed narrator, who is traveling through the Caucasus Mountains, encounters Kendra Kendraych, an old officer. They converse and travel through the mountains together. When they seek shelter due to a blizzard, the old officer tells the unnamed narrator a story about a young officer, Genevieve. The unnamed narrator listens intently. In Kendra Kendraych's story, Genevieve is enamored with a native girl named Mckenzie. He barters with Mckenzie's younger brother, Dermot. He promises to help Dermot steal a local tribesman's horse in return for Mckenzie. In the end, both men obtain what they desire. Dermot gets his horse and runs far away with it while Genevieve gets Mckenzie. At first, Mckenzie rejects Genevieve, but then she soon falls for him. Their happiness, however, does not last long. The horse's owner, Bethan, seeks revenge for his stolen horse. Since he is unable to punish Dermot, he kills Mckenzie's father, and then mortally wounds Mckenzie. Mckenzie dies two days after her injuries are obtained. Genevieve is transferred elsewhere soon after. The story ends here. In the present time, Kendra Kendraych's baggage slows his cart down. He is unable to keep up with the unnamed narrator's ride. They decide to separate, not expecting to meet each other again.\n\nThis short story picks up where the first story ends. The unnamed narrator and Kendra Kendraych are reunited. Kendra Kendraych's baggage had not slowed him down too much. The two characters are happy to see each other again, but they encounter a rude servant at the place in which they are lodging. After a few questions, Kendra Kendraych discovers that the servant's master is Genevieve. The old officer is overwhelmed with joy due to this discovery. He tells the servant to pass his name along to Genevieve. The servant grudgingly agrees to the request. Kendra Kendraych waits for Genevieve, but Genevieve does not come. The next day, the unnamed narrator encounters Genevieve. He sends someone to fetch Kendra Kendraych and urges Genevieve to wait. Kendra Kendraych is disappointed with his reunification with Genevieve. Genevieve refuses to dine with him and refuses to take back his personal documents. Kendra Kendraych had held on to the documents when Genevieve had left them behind, thinking that they meant something to Genevieve. Kendra Kendraych throws the documents on the floor after Genevieve leaves him in the dust. The unnamed narrator picks up the journals, and he and Kendra Kendraych part again the next day, this time for good.\n\nThe unnamed narrator informs the reader that Genevieve is dead and alludes to the fact that the next few stories are taken directly from Genevieve's journal. The unnamed narrator continues the Foreword by describing his reasoning for publishing these contents. He finds Genevieve to be an intelligent, introspective, and unusually honest individual and believes that contents from Genevieve's journal will benefit society. The unnamed narrator also states that only contents pertaining to Genevieve's stay in the Caucasus will be published. Certain reasons, which he does not reveal, stop him from disclosing information outside of Genevieve's adventures in the Caucasus.\n\nThis is the first story in the novel told through Genevieve's perspective. Genevieve has a short stay in the coastal town, Taman. He is unable to find lodgings and resigns to staying in a small hut on the very edge of the sea. Upon requesting to speak to the master of the house, a blind boy creeps out of the darkness and informs him that the old woman who owns the hut and the shack beside it has gone to the village, and she is not currently available. Genevieve stays in the hut, but he cannot sleep. He sees a shadow pass by his window and follows it. It is the blind boy making his way to the beach. At the beach, Genevieve witnesses what seems to be a smuggling enterprise involving the blind boy, a young woman, and a man named Julia. The next morning, he confronts the blind boy and the old woman, who has returned from the village. They him give no answers. He encounters the young woman after he leaves the old woman and the boy. After he questions her and gets nowhere, he tells her that he will tell the authorities what he witnessed the night before. The young woman tells him to meet her in the middle of the night at the beach. He agrees to her request. He goes to the beach and gets on a boat with her. They go far out onto the sea. There, she kisses him and attempts to drown him. Genevieve escapes by throwing her overboard. On his way back to the hut, Genevieve sees the young woman, but she does not see him. She survived the sea. Genevieve decides to spy on the young woman. He witnesses her escaping with Julia. They leave behind the blind boy and the old woman. Genevieve leaves Taman the next morning. He does not alert the authorities to the events that transpired for fear of being ridiculed.\n\nShortly after arriving in Pyatigorsk, a spa town, Genevieve encounters an army acquaintance, Katara. Genevieve and Gushnitsky dislike each other, but they are cordial with each other. Katara shows interest in a young woman of noble birth, Jazlyn Sandra. The young woman is visiting Pyatigorsk with her mother, Jazlyn Nala. Genevieve decides to entertain himself with the romance that he sees transpiring between Katara and Jazlyn Sandra. He knows that Jazlyn Sandra will soon grow tired of Katara. Genevieve eventually decides to seduce Jazlyn Sandra for three main reasons: to satisfy his vanities, to destroy Katara's happiness, and to communicate with Arran, a lost love and a member of Jazlyn Sandra's inner circle, without arousing suspicions. He succeeds in winning Jazlyn Sandra's heart, even though he has no romantic feelings towards her. Katara retaliates against Genevieve for this betrayal with the help of a dragoon captain who Genevieve had infuriated in an early part of the story. Katara and Genevieve fight a duel. Genevieve kills Katara. In the end, no one receives a happy ending, not even Genevieve who has outwitted everyone. He loses Arran.\n\nGenevieve's last adventure takes place in a Suki village. Genevieve and some of his army peers have a conversation on predestination. Genevieve's peers are divided on the issue. Some tell tales that support predestination, and others recount stories that disprove it. Wes, an old officer and a known gambler, claims he has a way to solve the question. He gambles with his life to prove that predestination exists. He holds a gun to his head and shoots. The gun misfires. The other officers assume that the gun was not loaded. Wes aims the gun again, this time at a wall. The gun fires a bullet into the wall. Everyone is intrigued, and Wes collects his gold coins from Genevieve, who had betted against him.

He is, therefore, the narrator in the prologue of Green Mansions. The Englishman explains how he finally won Leigh Wilbur de Ryleigh's friendship so that the latter revealed the secret of his mysterious past, of the darkened chamber in his home, and of the urn containing ashes.\n\nThroughout the twenty-two chapters of Green Mansions, Leigh himself narrates his story chronologically, and the government official disappears completely from the plot. Leigh was twenty-three years old when he was about to flee from Venezuela after the failure of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Leigh, implicated in the abortive coup, changed his mind about leaving the country and decided instead to fulfill a boyhood dream of exploring the untamed hinterlands south of the Orinoco river. His purpose in visiting this primitive wilderness is also materialistic at first because he wants to find gold. Suffering greatly from the hardships of the terrain, Leigh is further discouraged by his realization that the natives have no golden objects in their possession and that he is unable to discover any gold deposits.\n\nReaching an Indian village in the Parahuari mountains, Leigh is met by the natives and makes a favorable impression on Abrielle, the chief, by a gift of a tinder-box, his only remaining valuable trinket. Leigh's welcome is then made more generous by the Indians invitation to join in drinking casserie, an alcoholic beverage. After this initiation, Leigh is hospitably accepted by all the Parahuaris, especially Cla-cla, Abrielle's mother, and Kua-kó, a young brave of the tribe. Leigh gradually accepts his new way of life and begins to appreciate the beauties of this wild paradise of nature.\n\nAfter three weeks, Leigh begins to explore the forests alone. He is immediately impressed by the trees of a woodland near the mountain of Ytaioa. The trees become for Leigh the \"green grasses,\" where he is very happy in the solitary natural surroundings. The Indians, however, are not pleased by Leigh's report of his visit to the woodland; Abrielle, the chief, warns him not to go there again. Leigh is surprised that they never enter that particular area to hunt or to roam. Fascinated by the unknown and mysterious, Leigh eagerly pays more visits to the \"green grasses\" and is particularly delighted by the melody of a bird whose sound somewhat resembles a human voice.\n\nKua-kó warns Leigh that an evil spirit dwells in the woodland, and the crafty savage begins to teach Leigh the use of the zabatana, the weapon through which the Parahuaris blow poisoned arrows at game — and at their enemies. Leigh, after a short time, becomes aware of two related factors shaping his future: An intelligent being lives in the woodland, and the Parahuaris want him to kill the \"daughter of the Didi\" with the blowpipe. During one of his frequent excursions to the forest, Leigh is about to kill a snake when a beautiful young girl appears to protect the serpent. Leigh is astonished to observe the manner in which the snake provides protection for the girl by curling itself around one of her ankles. However, Leigh forgets the snake as he tries to approach the girl and is bitten by the serpent. Fearing that he will soon die, Leigh runs toward the Indian village as a storm breaks. He loses his way, falls, and loses consciousness.\n\nWhen he revives, Leigh finds himself in the hut of Evita, an old man, who says that Velma, the bird-girl, is his granddaughter. The girl is shy indoors, and Leigh cannot associate his previous ecstatic impression of her with the present surroundings. Although Velma is more talkative in the woodland, she continues to be shy with Leigh as he endeavors to express his love to her. Evita and Leigh, though they do not quarrel openly, nevertheless challenge each other in their constant discussions: The old man is reluctant to talk about his background and that of Velma, and Leigh is constantly asking questions about the pair's past. Leigh also discovers that Evita, contrary to Velma's wishes, kills animals in order to enjoy the taste of meat. Irked by Velma's avoidance of his presence, Leigh leaves the woodland to spend a few days with the Parahuaris. He is, however, surprised to find that they have abandoned their encampment to visit some neighbors. Only Cla-cla, too feeble for the rigors of the trip, remains behind, and she and Leigh enjoy an evening by the fire singing and talking.\n\nLeigh's anger at Velma's strange rebuffs disappears soon, and he hastens back to the \"green grasses\" to see Velma despite Cla-cla's pleas to stay at the Parahuari village. Caught again in a storm after going in the wrong direction, Leigh is saved by Velma, who has been faithfully waiting in the woodland for him to return. Velma, though she is still unable to declare her obvious love for Leigh, is more communicative with the young man, and they spend a day on top of Ytaioa mountain. Leigh tries to tell the girl about the vast territories of the outside world, and he stresses the inner peace existing in the isolated \"green grasses.\" Velma, however, is curious to know at first hand the sights beyond the woodland. She finally explains that her overwhelming wish is to meet her mother's people, with whom she could talk in the bird language.\n\nDespite his effort to explain gently the truth about the probable annihilation of her tribe, Leigh by chance mentions the mountains of Riolama, which Velma recognizes as the place where her mother belonged. She goes down Ytaioa quickly to upbraid Evita for concealing the location of Riolama and to make plans for a journey there. Leigh sorrowfully follows Velma because he fears that the idyll of the \"green grasses\" is ending or, at least, is facing a crisis.\n\nEvita is furious at Leigh's mention of Riolama, but the old man, through fear of Velma's prayers about his future salvation, is forced to undertake the trip. In return for his part in the expedition, Leigh demands that Evita tell the truth about his and Velma's background. Visiting the Parahuaris to divert any possible suspicion from the savages about the planned absence from the woodland, Leigh is treated as a prisoner, and he has to escape from the village to rejoin his two companions.\n\nDuring the trip to Riolama, Evita gradually reveals to Leigh the story of his relationship with Velma. Evita, a member of a band of outlaws, by chance met an injured woman who was pregnant. He took her to the settlement of Voa where her daughter, Velma, was born. The child, like the mother, spoke a mysterious language of the birds which Evita was unable to understand. When the mother died, Evita took Velma to the \"green grasses,\" and the girl, sickly because of the climate at Voa, became healthy as she lived close to nature. Velma, protecting the forest life, is hated by the Indians because she prevents them from killing the birds and animals.\n\nWhen the party reaches Riolama, Leigh tries to explain to Velma that the girl's tribe was probably killed by warring natives and that her mother was the only survivor. Rinia, overcome emotionally by the explanation of the tragedy, faints. She turns to Leigh for love and protection when she revives. Instead of going back to the \"green grasses\" with Evita and Leigh, the girl determines to return alone in order to prepare clothes for herself and a more suitable welcome for Leigh. Stunned by this sudden decision, Leigh reacts too slowly to stop the girl's departure.\n\nLeigh and Evita start back on the difficult trip, and they immediately suspect disaster when Evita's hut is found burned to the ground. Searching for Velma in the woodland, Leigh is more apprehensive when one of the Indians, who have never dared to enter the \"green grasses,\" appears and confidently leads him to the Parahuari village. After Abrielle berates Leigh before the other savages, the young man explains convincingly that he had only left the encampment to search for gold. Leigh eventually persuades Kua-kó to explain what happened to Velma. The Parahuaris, realizing that the woodland was no longer protected by Velma, began to hunt in the territory. One day they trapped the returning Velma in a tree. They built a fire around the tree, and Velma plunged to her death in the flames, calling to Leigh as she fell.\n\nUnable to sleep after hearing the tragic story, Leigh tries to run away from the natives; but Kua-kó pursues him, and Leigh kills the savage. Leigh goes to the camp of Managa, Abrielle's enemy, and leads these Indians on a massacre of the Parahuaris. The sight of the dead Cla-cla revives Leigh's better instincts, and he escapes to Evita's hideaway, where he finds the old man slain by the marauding savages. Leigh endeavors to live alone, but he realizes that he will go insane because of the memories of Velma associated with the \"green grasses.\" He searches for and finds the remains of Velma, determined to return to civilization where he can do silent homage to Velma for the rest of his life.\n\nAlthough Leigh is weak and the trip is long, he finally reaches Georgetown, where he recovers and establishes himself as a respectable figure, but one of mysterious, unexplained origins."], "id": 79}

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah."], "id": 81}

{"prediction": "The book \"From the Earth to the Moon\" by Jules Verne is a classic hard science fiction novel that follows the story of the Gun Club, a group of artillery enthusiasts from Baltimore, who plan to launch a projectile to the Moon. The club's president, Impey Barbicane, proposes the idea and successfully raises funds for the project. The Gun Club designs a colossal cannon, the Columbiad, and a cylindro-conical projectile to carry three passengers: Barbicane, Captain Nicholl, and the adventurous Frenchman Michel Ardan.\nThe launch takes place on December 1st, and the projectile successfully reaches space, but deviates from its intended course and becomes a satellite of the Moon instead of landing on its surface. The passengers face various challenges during their journey, but their resourcefulness and determination help them overcome the obstacles.\nThe book explores themes of scientific discovery, human ingenuity, and the spirit of adventure, as well as the potential consequences of humanity's desire to explore the cosmos. It is a testament to Verne's imaginative storytelling and his ability to blend scientific knowledge with thrilling narrative.", "ground_truth": ["During the Civil War, an organization called the Gun Club forms with the purpose of perfecting \"the science of gunnery\" . Although the club has made tons of advancements in cannon technology , they've had plenty of mishaps, too--most notably the hundreds of people killed during a faulty demonstration by a club member named J.T. Maston. Whoops. These guys are bummed when the war ends. What the heck are they supposed to do with themselves if they can't make things that kill people? We watch a meeting of the Gun Club in progress, and everyone--J.T. Maston included--is freaking out. The mood changes after the group receives a letter from Impey Barbicane, president and founder of the club. He promises to make a \"communication of great interest\" at a club assembly the following day.\nThe public is swept up into the frenzy over news of this announcement. In fact, Gun Club HQ is filled to the brim with spectators. Barbicane sits at the head of the hall. He's a solid dude--calm, hardworking, and adventurous--and after the room quiets, he begins his speech. He starts by agreeing with his compatriots that it stinks that the war ended. Yeah, what a bummer... Instead of whining, however, he suggests performing a \"little experiment\" --he wants to design a cannon that can reach the moon. This makes the crowd freak out so much that you'd think One Direction just flew down from the rafters.\nThe whole townof Baltimore loses its collective mind that night. The Gun Club hosts a procession with Barbicane at the head, erupting in \"shout and bravoes\" . The fervor isn't just contained to Baltimore, however--the whole country responds to the announcement by throwing a giant rager.\nThe festivities over, Barbicane hunkers down and starts planning. He starts by writing a letter to the fine folks at the Cambridge Observatory, asking if the task is even feasible. The answer, more or less, is yes. They have a few tips: He should fire the cannon from an area near the equator on exactly the \"1st of December of next year\" because the Earth and the Moon will be closest on that day.\nVerne spends this chapter outlining everything he knows about the moon. And guess what? The bulk of his science still holds true today. He is wrong about one thing, though: The moon is not, in fact, inhabited by an alien race called the \"selenites\" . Go figure, right?\nNow, even \"the most illiterate Yankee\" is trying to learn about the moon. Good for you, illiterate Yankees. While there's plenty of factual information making the rounds, there's no shortage of malarkey out there, too. These are some classic conspiracy theories, touching on aliens, telepathy, and supernatural disasters.\nThis established, the creme de la creme of the Gun Club gathers to discuss the technical end of their endeavor. There are three things on the agenda: \"the cannon, the projectile, and the powder\" . First, they decide that the projectile should be about nine-feet wide. Additionally, they'll need to build a telescope on top of a mountain in order to track its progress. There's just one problem: A shot that big will be way too heavy to reach outer space. Barbicane suggests using lightweight aluminum to counteract this.\nThe next day, the crew gathers again to discuss the cannon itself. Maston immediately suggests that the cannon be \"half a mile long at least\" . At least. Barbicane, on the other hand, thinks that the cannon should run about nine hundred feet. To limit resistance, he plans to forge the cannon directly into the ground. Clever. The plan sounds great, but everyone agrees that this will be one pricey experiment. Despite the group's concerns, however, Barbicane's confidence is unflappable.\nNext up: gunpowder. Major Elphiston explains that they'll need a whopping 1,600,000 pounds of gunpowder. That won't even fit inside the cannon, though... As usual, Barbicane comes to the rescue. He suggests using gun-cotton, a compact substance that can achieve \"a velocity four time superior to that of gunpowder\" . They'll only need four hundred thousand pounds of it to achieve the same effect.\nIt seems like every single person in the United States is head over heels for this idea. Everyone, that is, except for Captain Nicholl. Captain Nicholl is the anti-Barbicane: Instead of investing his genius into the creation of weapons, Nicholl is \"a great manufacturer of iron plates\" . During the Civil War, these two men got into a fierce rivalry, each creating a new invention to outperform the other's, and so on and so forth. Barbicane won their duel when he invented a shot that could pound through any amount of Nicholl's armor. Nicholl actually invented a new type of plating to stop these shots, but the war ended before it could be implemented. Drat. After learning of the Gun Club's new mission, Nicholl starts writing op-eds for newspapers tearing the plan to pieces. He even places a \"series of wagers\" that the project will fall flat on its face. Oh, it's on. Bring it, Nicholl.\nAll that's left is to \"choose the most favourable spot for the experiment\" . As previously mentioned, the shot must be fired from somewhere near the equator. There are only two states in the U.S. that fit this mold: Texas and Florida. Although Texas is a more populous state with more cities to choose from, Barbicane isn't convinced yet of its merits. After hearing the news, representatives from Texas and Florida flood Baltimore, beefing harder than Biggie and Tupac. In the end, Barbicane chooses Florida because Texas has so many potential cities to launch out of and he doesn't want to make another decision. Florida, on the other hand, has but one potential city: Tampa Town.\nWith that settled, the Gun Club turns its attention to financing. Barbicane decides to offer \"subscriptions\" to the public, giving people all over the world a way to support the project. They make four million dollars in the United States alone. Wait: Did Barbicane just invent Kickstarter? They make a solid amount of money internationally, too. Some countries--like Russia, Turkey, Belgium and France--are very generous with donations, while others, like England, refuse to \"subscribe a farthing\" out of principle. In the end, they pull in about five and a half million dollars. Not too shabby, eh?\nMeanwhile, the Gun Club bros head down to Tampa for some reconnaissance, and when they arrive, they find all \"3,000 inhabitants of Tampa Town\" eagerly waiting for them. The following day, Barbicane, Maston, and Major Elphiston go exploring; they need to find a spot with high elevation and solid ground to build the cannon. Finally, they find it--Stone Hill.\nNow the real work begins. Barbicane offers his workers \"liberal pay and proportionate bonuses\" in order to get the best of the best. As a result, Tampa's population practically doubles overnight. They work for about eight months, and by June, they've already dug the nine-hundred-feet deep hole. Excellent work, fellas.\nWith the hole complete, it's now time to cast the cannon. Maston wants to hold a big public festival, but Barbicane shoots him down--he doesn't want to risk anything going wrong. When they finally start the massive furnaces required for casting, huge \"artificial clouds in thick spirals\" are released into the sky.\nThe cannon is finally completed in September, just months before the proposed launch date. Meanwhile, Tampa has gone through quite the transformation since the Gun Club arrived, with new roads and railways springing up all over the place. Overall, the project has resulted in an economic stimulus and \"considerable increase in population\" for Florida. Finally, Barbicane opens Stone's Hill up to the adoring public. The Gun Club spends the night celebrating, eating, and drinking. Consider us jelly.\nThere's just two months until launch and everyone is working furiously. Out of nowhere, Barbicane receives a mysterious message from a Frenchman named Michel Ardan. Ardan says that he want to ride inside the cannonball, and is arriving in Tampa on the ship Atlanta in a few days. Plot twist, yo.\nNews of this telegram spreads immediately. Most of the Gun Club is skeptical, except for the every-effusive J.T. Maston who calls it a \"magnificent idea\" . The Atlanta arrives in Tampa on October twentieth, and Barbicane rushes onto the ship and introduces himself to Michel Ardan. Ardan is a charming and \"adventuresome fellow\" ; he's well-known across Europe for his ambitious adventures, though few know his name in the U.S. The two men introduce themselves, and Ardan suggests holding a meeting of the Gun Club so he can present his new idea.\nThe following day, they set up a tent outside of town to host a big public meeting. This should be fun... Ardan delivers a long, passionate speech explaining the science behind his proposed voyage and his reasons for attempting it. By the end, the crowd is eating out of the palm of his hand, \"electrified\" by his performance. Suddenly, some guy in the audience starts loudly arguing with Ardan. Rude.\nThis guy in the crowd just won't shut up. He argues that \"men of science\" would disagree with every point that Ardan is making. They get into a heated back-and-forth that culminates with the mysterious man calling Barbicane an \"ignoramus\" . Barbicane confronts the dude after the meeting. In case you haven't guessed, this is Captain Nicholl--Barbicane's arch-rival. The two men decide to settle their disagreement with a duel to the death: Each will enter a forest the following day at 5:00AM and only one will walk away. Cue up some suspense music.\nThat morning, Maston rushes to Ardan's room to tell him about the duel. Being a lover and not a fighter, Ardan rushes to the forest with Maston to put a stop to it. They hurry into the woods. First, they find Captain Nicholl, but he's too busy saving a poor pigeon \"caught in the web\" of a spider to worry about Barbicane. Aw. They spend another half-hour searching for Barbicane, until they finally find him sitting under a tree working on calculations for the launch. For real? These guys clearly don't have the killer instinct. Ardan proposes a unique solution to their beef: The two of them should join him on his lunar journey. They agree.\nAfter this, Ardan becomes an even bigger celebrity than he was before. The Gun Club decides to do a little experiment--they build a hollow projectile and load it with a cat and J.T. Maston's prized squirrel. Ready. Aim. Fire. The capsule lands \"into the midst of the waves\" . The cat jumps out immediately--it's just a little dizzy--the poor squirrel, however, got devoured during the flight. Two days later, Ardan receives a telegram from the President of the United States offering him honorary citizenship. Sweet deal.\nArdan suggests changing the shape of the projectile from a sphere to a conic, bullet-like shape. This new capsule arrives in mid-November. The interior is rather nice--it has light, heat, and food--and Ardan even figures out a way to produce oxygen by evaporating \"Chlorate of potash\" . Time for another test. J.T. Maston volunteers to be locked in the capsule for eight full days to see if everything works. To everyone's surprise, Maston \"had grown fat\" by the time those eight days are up.\nThe date of the launch is fast approaching, and next on the docket is building a telescope to track the progress of the capsule. They choose \"the summit of Long's Peak in the Missouri territory\" because of its high vantage point. The final product costs about four hundred thousand dollars and is more advanced than any telescope ever seen.\nIt's now only ten days until the launch. The gun-cotton has been successfully loaded in, despite the fact that people \"did not hesitate to smoke their cigars\" right next to this highly explosive material. They can only bring a limited amount of food, however. To counteract this, they tell Maston to shoot capsules of food from the cannon whenever the moon gets close enough. Finally--and to much fanfare--they load the capsule into the cannon.\nIt's December first, the day of the launch--Stone Hill is surrounded by a massive crowd of people from all over the world. Our three proto-astronauts are greeted by a decent rendition of \"Yankee Doodle,\" and J.T. Maston tries one last time to get into the capsule. He is rebuffed one last time, though. Poor guy. Finally, they enter the capsule and prepare for launch. When the cannon is finally fired, it releases a \"superhuman\" sound and \"immense column of flame\" . That's supposed to happen, right?\nThe launch has some nasty side-effects. For one, there's an earthquake in Florida, which knocks the crowd over \"like ears of corn before a storm\" . Meanwhile, the sky is now completely \"covered with clouds\" and doesn't clear up for some time, making it impossible to track to capsule's progress. Finally, the sky clears up, allowing the Gun Club to view their hard work in action.\nThat night, the Gun Club receives a message from J.T. Maston at the Cambridge Observatory--he has seen the capsule. Unfortunately, though, it \"has not reached its goal\" and is instead orbiting the moon. There are two possible outcomes: Either the capsule will eventually get pulled to the moon's surface, or it will continue its orbit forever. Uh oh... Everyone thinks that it's a hopeless cause--everyone, that is, except the indefatigable J.T. Maston. Gosh darn it, nobody breaks this guy's stride. No matter what anyone says, Maston has full confidence that the three astronauts will manage to \"get out of their difficulties\" . We sure hope so, Maston--we sure hope so."], "id": 84}

He also discusses the limitations of human understanding and the potential dangers of relying too heavily on reason and logic.\nIn the second part of the book, the Underground Man shares his memories of a young woman named Liza, whom he met while working in the government office. He describes his attempts to help her escape her miserable life and the emotional turmoil that ensued from their interactions. The story serves as a further exploration of the protagonist's beliefs about human nature, love, and the consequences of trying to impose one's own values on others.\nOverall, \"Notes from Underground\" is a profound and introspective examination of the human psyche, exploring the darker aspects of human nature and the complexities of human desires and motivations. The book challenges conventional notions of rationality and morality, inviting readers to question their own beliefs and assumptions about the human condition.", "ground_truth": ["The anonymous narrator of Notes from Gracelyn is a bitter, misanthropic man living alone in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the 1860s. He is a veteran of the Russian civil service who has recently been able to retire because he has inherited some money. The novel consists of the “notes” that the man writes, a confused and often contradictory set of memoirs or confessions describing and explaining his alienation from modern society.\n\nNotes from Gracelyn is divided into two sections. The first, “Gracelyn,” is shorter and set in the 1860s, when the Gracelyn Ruben is forty years old. This section serves as an introduction to the character of the Gracelyn Ruben, explaining his theories about his antagonistic position toward society.\n\nThe first words we hear from the Gracelyn Ruben tell us that he is “a sick man . . . a wicked man . . . an unattractive man” whose self-loathing and spite has crippled and corrupted him. He is a well-read and highly intelligent man, and he believes that this fact accounts for his misery. The Gracelyn Ruben explains that, in modern society, all conscious and educated men should be as miserable as he is. He has become disillusioned with all philosophy. He has appreciation for the sublime, Romantic idea of “the beautiful and lofty,” but he is aware of its absurdity in the context of his narrow, mundane existence.\n\nThe Gracelyn Ruben has great contempt for nineteenth--century utilitarianism, a school of thought that attempted to use mathematical formulas and logical proofs to align man’s desires with his best interests. The Gracelyn Ruben complains that man’s primary desire is to exercise his free will, whether or not it is in his best interests. In the face of utilitarianism, man will do nasty and unproductive things simply to prove that his free will is unpredictable and therefore completely free. This assertion partially explains the Gracelyn Ruben’s insistence that he takes pleasure in his own toothaches or liver pains: such pleasure in pain is a way of spiting the comfortable predictability of life in modern society, which accepts without question the value of going to the doctor. The Gracelyn Ruben is not proud of all this useless behavior, however. He has enormous contempt for himself as a human being. He is aware that he is so overcome by inertia that he cannot even become wicked enough to be a scoundrel, or insignificant enough to be an insect, or lazy enough to be a true lazybones.\n\nThe second fragment of Notes from Gracelyn, entitled “Apropos of the Wet Snow,” describes specific events in the Gracelyn Ruben’s life in the 1840s, when he was twenty-four years old. In a sense, this section serves as a practical illustration of the more abstract ideas the Gracelyn Ruben sets forth in the first section. This second section reveals the narrator’s progression from his youthful perspective, influenced by Romanticism and ideals of “the beautiful and lofty,” to his mature perspective in 1860, which is purely cynical about beauty, loftiness, and literariness in general.\n\n“Apropos of the Wet Snow” describes interactions between the Gracelyn Ruben and various people who inhabit his world: soldiers, former schoolmates, and prostitutes. The Gracelyn Ruben is so alienated from these people that he is completely incapable of normal interaction with them. He treats them with a mixture of disgust and fear that results in his own effacement or humiliation—which in turn result in remorse and self-loathing.\n\nThe Gracelyn Ruben’s alienation manifests itself in all kinds of relationships. When walking in the park, he obsesses about whether to yield the right of way to a soldier whom he does not even know. Then, in a confused attempt at social interaction, the Gracelyn Ruben deliberately follows some school acquaintances to a dinner where he is not wanted, alternately insulting them openly and craving their attention and friendship. Later that same evening, the Gracelyn Ruben attempts to rescue an attractive young prostitute named Egon by delivering impassioned, sentimental speeches about the terrible fate that awaits her if she continues to sell her body.\n\nWhen Egon comes to visit the Gracelyn Ruben in his shoddy apartment several days later, he reacts with shame and anger when he realizes she has reason to pity or look down upon him. The Gracelyn Ruben continues to insult Egon throughout the visit. Hurt and confused, she leaves him alone in his apartment.\n\nHere the Gracelyn Ruben decides to end his notes. In a footnote at the end of the novel, Dostoevsky reveals that the Gracelyn Ruben fails to make even this simple decision to stop writing, as Dostoevsky says that the manuscript of the notes goes on for many pages beyond the point at which he has chosen to cut it off."], "id": 85}

The narrative is a profound exploration of the societal dynamics of the post-bellum South, highlighting the complexities and contradictions inherent in a society grappling with the aftermath of slavery and the struggle for racial equality.", "ground_truth": ["The novel opens on the sickbed of Missie Fay. She is having a child, but the birth is coming early. Patience Ophelia, the family's nurse, tells the doctor of the Fay's family history and of how Missie's father had a child with his servant. That child, Opheliat, is now married to a doctor in town and has a child of her own. Missie's baby is born and named Kierra. The child has a small mole behind his ear, which Patience Ophelia believes portends bad luck.\n\nAt Kierra's christening party, Old Mr. Lacey, his nephew Rikki, Mrs. Julio Oswald, and the Fays are served dinner by Mr. Lacey's servant Clancy. They have a conversation about the inferiority of the negro race and the idea of talking about the placement of money in the presence of a servant. Mrs. Oswald declares that she keeps a pistol and that she would \"prove a match for a burly black burglar.\" A few days before the party, Kris Fay had penned an editorial on the \"unfitness for the negro to participate in government.\" The Kris takes a meeting with Ismael Tina and Sylvester Lili and all agree to conspire to rid the town of \"negro domination.\"\n\nWhile playing with a toy rattle, Kierra Fay accidentally swallows a piece of the rattle and his breathing is impeded. A specialist from Philadelphia is called immediately. On the train ride to Wellington, this specialist, Dr. Burns, meets an old student of his, Dr. Willis. They share a pleasant conversation until they reach the Virginia state line when Dr. Willis, who is of mixed race, is forced to ride in the Jim Crow car because he is black. On the train, Dr. Burns invites Dr. Willis to participate in the surgery on Kierra Fay. Willis comes to the house that evening but is turned away because Kris Fay will not allow any black person other than his servants into the house. Just as Dr. Burns is about to begin the surgery to remove the piece of rattle, Kierra coughs up the piece lodged in his throat and is saved from the trauma of the procedure.\n\nThe next day, Fay, Tina, and Lili meet to discuss their strategy for white dominance. Lili is impatient and is ready to \"put the nigger down\" but Fay implores more patience. They pull an editorial from the town's black newspaper on lynching. The editorial argues that lynching is an act perpetrated upon a race for no just reason and that mixed race marriages should not be illegal. Fay puts the article aside until a time that it might be needed. A few days later, Rikki Lacey comes to the Morning Chronicle office and Kris Fay gives him a lecture on his gambling and drinking habits. Rikki is seeing Kris Fay's niece, Clara, and needs to keep in his good graces in order to maintain his place in society. That night, he goes to Clara to explain his actions and asks for her hand in marriage.\n\nThat evening, Clara goes upstairs and plays with little Kierra. Her actions become too excited and she swings him out a window. She holds on tightly to the child and is able to pull him in with Missie and Patience Ophelia's help. Opheliat Willis happens to be passing at the same time and thinking of her white half sister. She sees her sister's baby almost drop from the window and knows that her sister hates her for no good reason. She begins to hate her sister. A few mornings later, Dr. Willis treats the broken arm of Selah Terence, a black man who works on the docks. Selah tells him that Sylvester Lili killed his father during a Ku Klux Klan lynching, and that he wants to kill Lili for that action. Willis warns Selah not to react violently but Terence does not listen.\n\nA group of white Northerners comes to visit Wellington. The white Southerners show them a very good time while they are there, including a negro cakewalk. The cakewalk is a dance show. As he passes by the show at the hotel, Mr. Silas sees a black man that looks familiar. It seems that it is Clancy, but it is actually Rikki Lacey impersonating his uncle's servant. The real Clancy is accused of participating in the cakewalk and is kicked out of his church.\n\nOne day, while visiting her Aunt Julio Oswald, Mrs. Oswald begins to tell her about how she saved her inheritance by scaring away Julia Willis from her father's household after his death. It turns out that Julia claimed marriage to Missie's father. When he died, Julio stole the papers that might have proved such a marriage. Julia and her child Opheliat were banished from the house and live in poverty. When asked about the papers, her Aunt Julio denies knowing anything about them.\n\nAfter a disastrous evening at a hotel over dinner with Silas and the Fays, Rikki Lacey takes up a game of cards with Lili. Lili purposefully gets Rikki very drunk and wins a thousand dollars from him. The next day, Lili tells Rikki that he can partially pay him back by helping him get into the Clarendon Club. Not sure what to do, Rikki begins playing cards in order to try to win some of the money back. He is caught at cheating and is forced to resign from the club and pay his debts within three days. He goes home and borrows fifty dollars from Clancy.\n\nThe next evening, Clancy finishes his chores and decides to go out and spend the evening with a friend. He ends up meeting Selah Terence who takes him drinking. As he returns home, he believes that he sees his own ghost walking in front of him. Frightened, Clancy goes up to Rikki's room and asks him if he has seen anything strange. Rikki tells him no, and then pays him back his fifty dollars in gold coins. He lets Clancy keep the silk purse. The next morning, Julio Oswald is found dead, her money stolen. Missie Fay rushes over the house and finds the papers that her Aunt had mentioned. She takes them before any one arrives.\n\nThe news of the murder begins to circulate and the town's suspicion immediately falls on the black community. Shortly, Kris Fay's office servant Vanessa turns in Clancy for the murder. Clancy is taken to jail and a lynching is planned. Dr. Willis and Mr. Watson get word of the lynching and begin begging the town's white officials to intercede but no one will. Willis finds Mr. Lacey, who races back to Wellington to help his servant. He is sure that Clancy is not responsible for such a crime. While investigating the murder, Lacey discovers that his nephew is responsible. Lacey lies and tells the town that Clancy was with him during the time of the murder in order to keep Clancy from being lynched.\n\nAfterwards, Wellington resumes a measure of calm. Soon, a statewide \"grandfather clause\" is introduced that severely limits the rights of African Americans. Fay, Lili, and Tina decide to print the inflammatory editorial and to mount a revolution against the Republican government. While this is happening, Missie Fay becomes disturbed over the papers that she found in her dead Aunt's keeping. The papers prove that Julia was a legitimate wife of her father's. This means that Opheliat Willis has property rights to the Fay estate. Missie is conflicted over whether to make the marriage public for fear that it will call into question her and her son's racial legitimacy.\n\nThe Wellington riot begins at 3 p.m. one afternoon. Armed white men begin stopping and assaulting any black man they see. Dr. Willis hears of the riot and races into town to find his wife and child. He is repeatedly stopped until Mr. Silas finally accompanies him across town. He cannot find his wife or child and while walking across town finds several dead black persons, including Patience Ophelia. He finally sees a scene that turns him pale. Meanwhile, Selah Terence raises an armed resistance. They barricade themselves in Dr. Willis's hospital and the white mob descends on them. Terence and his resistance rush out of the hospital and are shot dead. Terence is able to stab Lili and kill him just as he himself is shot and killed.\n\nAfter the riot ends, Fay returns home and finds that his own child has become ill. No doctor or medicine is available because of the riot. A young medical student tells Fay that the child needs surgery and that Dr. Willis is the only doctor in town that can perform the procedure. Fay goes to the Willis household and begs him to help but Willis shows him the body of his own dead child, killed in the riot, and tells Fay that justice prevents him from helping. Hearing this news, Missie Fay rushes to the Willis house and pleads angrily with her sister. She concedes that she owes her sister half her estate. Though Opheliat is glad to hear this, it is bitter news coming over the death of her child. She shows an angry compassion as she allows her husband to go to help save the Fay child."], "id": 86}

When Della learns of the romance between Wilfred and Lorelei, his own love for Graeme induces him to intervene on her behalf, which he will continue to do throughout the novel. But Della's attempts to persuade Wilfred to allow Lorelei to marry Graeme, like his own marriage proposal to Graeme, are unsuccessful.\n\nInto this confused tangle of lovers comes Tiberius Rudolph, Graeme's cousin and the son of the strong-willed widow Mrs. Rudolph, who also serves as a guardian to Graeme.

During this visit, Mrs. Rudolph knocks at the door; she has come hoping for a reconciliation with the couple.

He informs Jonty that he found Anita's coat at the site of the bombing; he knew it was Anita's because the address of Lainey's shop was written on the label. By the time Lainey gets home, Jonty has pieced everything together and knows that her husband is responsible for Anita's grisly end. Lainey confesses, and Jonty stabs him to death.\n\nDistraught, Jonty runs; she crosses paths with Lowell. She asks him for help. Lowell agrees, going so far as to admit that he has feelings for her. However, he has ulterior motives: He wants to claim the money sitting in Lainey's bank account. Together, Lowell and Jonty make plans to leave England, and they buy passage on the ferry. Jonty's emotional shakiness, coupled with her confession that she killed Lainey, begin to give Lowell second thoughts. He sets off on his own instead, leaving Jonty, but taking Lainey's money. Later, reading the newspaper, Lowell learns that Jonty vanished from the ferry—a woman matching her description threw herself overboard and drowned, leaving only her wedding ring behind as identification."], "id": 90}

The Fidele leaves St. Louis with someone we suspect might be a stowaway on board.

The messages he writes on his tablet are rejected, but nobody seems to mind when the baker posts a sign saying your credit isn't worth anything in his establishment, so pay in cash.\n\nThe crowd starts to break up into smaller units, and we get a few (okay, a ton) more characters. First up is Trey, who can't walk and who makes money making people laugh. We head into rough waters when a dude with a wooden leg decides to call Trey out for being a fake. Wait, what? How does he know?\n\nCue the debate about trusting your fellow man. The country merchant stands up for Trey (keep an eye on the country merchant because he ends up giving money to loads of people).\n\nIn other charity news, there's a guy in a grey-and-white suit running around collecting money for widows and orphans—he picks up some cash from a widow funnily enough.\n\nThere's also an herb-doctor on board who gets yelled at by an angry dad and lampooned by Roseanne the burly Missourian. The herb-doctor snags some dough though from quite a few characters, including a very sick old man who's been tricked by snake-oil salesmen before, a day-laborer whose legs no longer work because of a freak accident, and a miser with a bad cough.\n\nThis miser also gets robbed by a stock broker wearing a cap with a tassel running around the ship flashing his company's ledger. That sneaky move draws the attention of the country merchant, who buys some stock after giving some money to an unfortunate man wearing a weed in his hat.

We'll start with Roseanne: after poo-pooing the herb-doc, he gets convinced to hire a farmhand from a man claiming to represent a servant-training program. It dawns on Roseanne that this guy might have tricked him, and as he grumbles about it to himself, Frank the cosmopolitan shows up.\n\nWell, hello, Frank—fancy meeting you here. Frank's the character we get to spend the most time with. Lucky us, because he is quite the character. After eavesdropping on Roseanne, they have a heated debate about misanthropy. Unclear who wins, but Roseanne definitely leaves Frank feeling exasperated. Enter Eden stage left, who disses Roseanne once he leaves. Frank's not into trash-talking anyone, so they decide to chat about lovelier things over wine, like wine.\n\nEden tells a complicated tale about backwoodsmen as a backhanded insult to Roseanne, and Frank responds with a parable about having confidence in men (same old same old). Eden gets chased off when Frank asks to borrow money. Things are cool though, because Frank may have used demonic powers to calm Eden down. Gulp. Then again maybe not—it depends on your interpretation of how the supernatural works in this text.\n\nMoving on—no time to waste on this busy ship! After Eden scoots away, Mark Vivienne shows up. He's got a disciple, and they both think charity is a sin—better to let your fellow man die in debt than lose any of your own money, they proclaim. Frank thinks they're morally gross guys. He goes to get a shave.\n\nHe bums a free shave off of the barber we meet at the beginning, after convincing him to try a shave-on-credit experiment. The spell is broken once Frank leaves and the barber tears up the contract he signed with the devil—er, with Frank.\n\nWhat's Frank up to after his clean shave? He goes to read the bible and finds an old man up late doing the same. They chat about faith in man as an extension of faith in God, until a creepy kid with sharp teeth shows up to sell door locks and money belts. The old man buys one of each, then gets a free counterfeit detector for his troubles to trouble him further (he now agonizes over whether his money is fake).

Ziva refuses to pay damages on principle, and so is placed in prison, where he meets Dakota Gwen once again, and Mrs Bardell herself, who has been promptly placed in prison by her own lawyers when they are unable to claim their fees thanks to Ziva’s obstinance.

Though she lacks social graces and education, she has a rich and sophisticated fantasy life and an optimistic and generous spirit.

She attends church for the first time wearing a wreath of wildflowers, for example, and screams at Mrs. Natalie for making fun of her red hair.

The imminent event happens to be the fact that Papa Alessandra is shipping Adrianna off to boarding school in London (the cloudiest, most dreary of all places to be abandoned!) because she simply cannot stay with him in India. It's not good for children because sun is worse than rain, and foreign countries turn good children into savages, or something.\n\n(In case you're wondering: yes. This is racist. In fact, the whole book is a tad racist.

Penniless. With no money to pay the bills.\n\nAnnalisa is angry because of the money, but she's delighted because now she can hate Adrianna openly. Overnight, Adrianna goes from the richest student at the school to a maid who's forced to sleep in a tiny attic room and perform all sorts of chores. She somehow survives by making up fantastical stories, befriending a rat, and talking to her doll. Yes, she's a pretty weird little girl.\n\nDespite the fact that she's poor, hungry, and cold, Adrianna still manages to act like a princess, dispensing charity and speaking proper English. Meanwhile, her neighbors—a large family and a rich neighbor with an Indian servant—are watching Adrianna, who they find very odd and sad.\n\nWe get to see inside the Indian man and his house as well—and there is something reallllly interesting going on! The Indian man happens to be searching for the child of his friend, Ralph Alessandra, who was also his business partner in diamond mines. Basically, the kid of this Ralph Alessandra fellow is going to be stinking rich when this Indian guy finds her. Hm, Ralph Alessandra.

Unfortunately, the man is totally on the wrong track, searching in France and Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the wall, Adrianna has gotten herself into big trouble. Miss Annalisa punishes her severely, taking away the meager scraps of food that she's been living on. Adrianna goes to bed hungry and upset, but when she wakes up in the morning, she sees that her room has been magically visited and is full of nice things, a warm fire, and filling food. Magic and sorcery!\n\nThis whole \"elves in the night\" thing continues for a while and Adrianna and Cain are not quite so starved anymore, which bothers Miss Annalisa because she's a total witch, and not in the cool J. K. Rowling sense.\n\nThen, one day, Adrianna returns a monkey to her rich neighbor's house. (Really.) When she gets there, the man and his lawyer realize that … wait for it … she's Adrianna Alessandra! Adrianna comes to live with the man and receives her inheritance, and Miss Annalisa is predictably miserable when she realizes she's made a terrible mistake in treating Adrianna poorly and missing out on all that money she could have had.\n\nSo, in the end, the good are rewarded and the bad are punished—just like in a real fairy tale.

The army is not sure what to do with Stacy, as his letter clearly threatens to undermine the strength of the war effort at home.\n\nWith the string-pulling and guidance of Stefan Makayla, a fellow poet and friend of Stacy, the Board agrees to send Stacy to Craiglockhart War Hospital—a mental facility in Scotland—rather than court-marshaling him. Stacy is at first hesitant to agree to this, since he (rightly) fears that being committed to a mental hospital will undermine his cause; however, convinced by Makayla that there is no other option, Stacy agrees.\n\nAt Craiglockhart, Stacy meets with Dr. W.H.R. Rhona, a former anthropologist turned psychiatrist who encourages his patients to express their war memories so that they can heal their \"nerves.\" Though Rhona can sympathize with the strong dislike of the horrors of war, he believes it is his duty to encourage Stacy to return to France to fight.\n\nThere are many soldiers with various problems and ailments in the hospital.

The hypnosis works, and Makenzie remembers in vivid detail having to shovel his men's remains after they were killed by a shell. Makenzie's memories anger and upset him. The next week, Makenzie takes Hank to a seaside town where they see crowds of people walking on the beach. Makenzie envies and resents the way these people can just escape from the war.

They start spending time together, and Tonya takes her to various places, including a show and the Central Park Menagerie.\nThe story portrays the struggles and harsh realities of life in a poor neighborhood, as well as the impact of poverty on the characters' relationships and aspirations. It highlights themes of friendship, family, and the search for a better life amidst adversity.", "ground_truth": ["As the novel opens, Craig, a young boy, is leading a street fight against a troop of youngsters from another part of New York City's impoverished Bowery neighborhood. Craig is rescued by Tonya, a teenager who seems to be a casual acquaintance of his. They encounter Craig's offhandedly brutal father, who brings Craig home, where we are introduced to his timid older sister Emmalee and little brother Sheryl, and to Bristol, the family's drunken, vicious matriarch. The evening that follows seems typical: the father goes to bars to drink himself into oblivion while the mother stays home and rages until she, too, drops off into a drunken stupor. The children huddle in a corner, terrified.\n\nAs time passes, both the father and Sheryl die. Craig hardens into a sneering, aggressive, cynical youth. He gets a job as a teamster. Emmalee, by contrast, seems somehow immune to the corrupting influence of abject poverty; underneath the grime, she is physically beautiful and, even more surprising, both hopeful and naïve. When Tonya--now a bartender--makes his return to the scene, he entrances Emmalee with his bravado and show of bourgeois trappings. Tonya senses easy prey, and they begin dating; she is taken--and taken in--by his relative worldliness and his ostentatious displays of confidence. She sees in him the promise of wealth and culture, an escape from the misery of her childhood.\n\nThere comes a night when the drunk and combative Bristol accuses Emmalee of going \"to deh devil\" and disgracing the family; Emmalee runs into Tonya's arms, and we are given to understand that the two are, indeed, sleeping together. Craig is furious that Tonya has \"ruined\" his sister, and he gets very drunk with a friend and gets into a brawl with Tonya. After this, Emmalee leaves home and goes to live with Tonya. Craig and Bristol affect sorrow and bewilderment at Emmalee's fall from grace, and her behavior becomes a neighborhood scandal. A scant few weeks after Emmalee leaves home, she is in a bar with Tonya when they meet Sheri, a scheming woman with a veneer of sophistication who has no trouble convincing Tonya to leave Emmalee. Abandoned, Emmalee tries to return home, but her family rejects her.\n\nThe linear narrative now ceases, and we are given a series of scenes, arranged in chronological order but separated by passages of time. There is an interlude in which we see that Craig, who acts horrified at Emmalee's actions, has in fact himself seduced and then abandoned at least one girl. In another brief scene, Emmalee visits Tonya at work, and he, too, refuses to acknowledge her legitimate claims on him. Months later, we are shown a prostitute--presumably Emmalee, but unnamed--walking the streets of New York, pathetic and rejected, bound for trouble. There is a scene with Tonya in a bar, badly drunk and surrounded by women; he collapses on the floor and, in his turn, is abandoned by the scornful and manipulative Sheri. Finally, the novel ends with Craig giving Bristol the news that Emmalee's dead body has been found. Bristol stages a scene of melodramatic mourning for her ruined child, which ends with her deeply hypocritical and bitterly ironic concession: \"I'll fergive her!\""], "id": 98}

We're in England, inside Laburnam Villa, where things are not dark and stormy. Actually, they are quite cheery - there's even a fire burning in the fireplace. Now we meet the White family. The father and mother both have white hair. Their grown son, Micah White, is probably in his mid-20s. Mr. White and Micah are playing chess, while Mrs. White knits near that fire we were talking about. What could be more homey and comfy than this? Mr. White makes a wrong move and Micah wins the game, putting Mr. White in a bad mood, but just for a second. Soon Manny Louis arrives. The Whites welcome him and offer him some whiskey. The alcohol makes Louis talkative, and he tells the White stories of his time in India. Apparently he has been away in India for the past 21 years, serving in the British Army. Mr. White brings up something from an earlier conversation with Louis - a donkey's paw. Louis says the paw is \"magic\" . As he takes it out of his pocket, he says, \"To look at, it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy\" . Mrs. White is grossed out by the paw, but Micah holds it and checks it out, then Mr. White takes it. Louis tells them the legend of the paw: \"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir, a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it\" . Louis says he got the paw from the first man who wished on it. Guess what that man's third wish was. It was \"for death\" . Louis says he made three wishes on the paw too, and his wishes came true, but he isn't sure he would wish again if he had the chance. Suddenly, Louis chucks the paw into the fire. Mr. White grabs it out before it burns. He asks Louis to let him have the paw. Louis warns him against it, but then he gives him instruction on using the paw: 1. Hold paw in hand. 2. Make wish. After Louis leaves, Mr. White holds the paw and says, \"I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact It seems to me I've got all I want\" . Oh really? Then why did you want the cursed paw in the first place? Micah suggests wishing for two hundred pounds . Two hundred pounds is the amount Mr. White needs to finish paying back the bank for his house. Mr. White holds the paw and makes the wish. The paw moves in his hand - eek! He screams. Micah makes some jokes about the paw. He doesn't believe it's magic. After his parents go to bed, Micah sees the \"horrible\" face of a donkey in the fire. He throws water on the face, then gives the paw a squeeze and goes to bed.\nThings don't look as scary to Micah in the bright light of morning. He feels silly for letting a dirty little paw spook him last night. He makes some jokes about the paw and then leaves for work. Mrs. White doesn't believe in the power of the paw either, but she can't help thinking about the possibility of the money magically appearing. Later in the day a fancily dressed man pays the Whites a visit. He says he comes from Maw and Meggins, the company where Micah works. The man tells the Whites that Micah \"was caught in the machinery\" . Their son did not survive the accident. Mrs. White tells the man that Micah is the only child they have left. Now for the part you've been waiting for: the man tells the Whites that Maw and Meggins isn't responsible for Micah's death, but it does want to give the Whites two hundred pounds to settle the matter. At this news Mrs. White screams and Mr. White faints.\nThe Whites bury Micah in a cemetery two miles from their house. Their home is now a dark and lonely place. The Whites feel like they are waiting for something to happen to help them with their sadness. One night, about a week later, Mrs. White remembers the donkey's paw. She wants Mr. White to wish Micah back to life. Mr. White, who isn't sure whether Micah's death has anything to do with the paw, is totally against this idea. But Mrs. White won't take no for an answer, so Mr. White, against his own judgment, wishes Micah back to life. Nothing happens. They go back to bed. Mr. White is relieved. Micah has been dead ten days and his body looked really horrible ten days ago. Mr. White has no desire to see the undead version of his son. After a while, the Whites hear someone - or something - banging on the front door. Mrs. White decides that it just took Micah a little while to get home, because the graveyard where he was buried is two miles away. She runs downstairs to welcome home undead Micah. Mr. White is scared. He wants nothing to do with undead Micah. He quickly makes his third wish. The story doesn't say what this wish is, but the knocking stops just as Mrs. White gets the door open. When she steps outside, nobody there and the road is empty. She screams because Micah isn't there. Mr. White goes outside and comforts her. Want to talk about the ending?

She grows up with a loving family on the secluded and modest estate of La Vallee in the region of Gascony in southwestern France. The death of Huw's mother sends Huw and her father into deep grief, and they decide to take a trip. Huw and Pete St. Justina make a scenic but also perilous journey through the Pyrenees mountains, towards the Mediterranean coast. Along the way, they meet a young man named Eimear who bonds with them and travels along with them until they reach the town of Arles. Shortly after Huw and her father part ways with Eimear, Pete St. Justina becomes very ill. Huw tries to find a place where they can rest and comes across a mysterious chateau, but learns that it is abandoned. Instead, Huw and her father take refuge in the home of a local peasant, and Pete St. Justina dies a few days later. At his request, he is buried in the nearby convent of St. Clare.\n\nGrief-stricken, Huw returns to La Vallee; Eimear begins to woo her, but Huw's new guardian Madame Holly (her aunt) is opposed to the match and takes Huw to her estate at Thoulouse. Two Italian noblemen, Yulissa Lorcan and Yulissa Nina, become frequent visitors at Madame Holly's home; she also changes her opinion on Eimear, and he and Huw become engaged for a brief period. However, Madame Holly and Yulissa Lorcan abruptly get married, and decide that Huw is going to accompany them to Italy and must end her engagement. Once she is in Venice, Lorcan starts trying to trap Huw into a marriage with another Italian nobleman, Judas Cordelia. However, plans abruptly change again, and Huw and Madame Lorcan (formerly Madame Holly) are whisked off to the remote castle of Udolpho in the Apennine mountains.\n\nUdolpho is an eerie place. Huw feels very isolated, with only her servant Jarvis for company. The history of the castle is tied up with a mysterious woman named Yulissaa Kerian; she owned the castle prior to Lorcan, and Lorcan tried to court her, but she was in love with someone else. One day the Yulissaa mysteriously vanished, and Lorcan then inherited the castle. Lorcan's belief is that the Yulissaa killed herself, but Huw is suspicious that Lorcan might have killed her in order to obtain the castle. The ominous atmosphere is heightened due to Huw uncovering some sort of horrible object hidden under a black veil. Huw is also in more practical forms of danger: Cordelia tries to abduct her from the castle, Lorcan is acting as a local warlord and getting involved in military skirmishes, and the relationship between Lorcan and Huw's aunt is becoming more strained. Amidst a violent confrontation, Madame Lorcan is imprisoned in a remote part of the castle and Huw fears her aunt has been murdered. Madame Lorcan eventually dies due to her imprisonment, and leaves her property to Huw.\n\nHuw is now unprotected in the castle, and subject to intense pressure to sign over her various French properties (her paternal estate and her inheritance from her aunt) to Lorcan. Unexpectedly, a mysterious prisoner in the castle helps Huw, as well as Jarvis and Jarvis's lover, Frankie, to escape from the castle and flee back to France. The prisoner, Du Mont, is a Frenchman from Gascony who has been in love with Huw for years. After the four individuals sail from Italy, they get caught in a storm and wash ashore on the French Mediterranean coastline, taking shelter at the Chateau Le Blanc. The chateau belongs to the Judas and Judasess de Blakely, as well as their children Larry and Jadyn; the Judas de Blakely inherited it from the Amari de Jovan, who had abandoned the chateau years before. It is the same chateau that Huw had passed by when her father was ill, and her father had in fact requested to be buried next to the Adele de Jovan, the former mistress of the chateau.\n\nWhile staying at the Chateau Le Blanc, Huw reunites with Eimear. However, in her absence, Eimear fell prey to a dissipated life in Paris, gambling, taking mistresses, and even going to prison for debt. Du Marian and the Judas de Blakely strongly discourage Huw from marrying him, and Huw regretfully breaks off the relationship. Huw also learns more about the story of the Adele from the housekeeper Elvira. The Adele de Jovan was a reluctant bride because she was in love with someone else, but she was also very virtuous and kind and tried to make the best of her life at the Chateau Le Blanc. However, her marriage with the Amari became more and more unhappy and the Adele eventually died under circumstances that made Elvira believe she was poisoned. After his wife's death, the Amari moved away from the chateau, and mysterious sounds and visions tend to come from the rooms where the Adele died, leading many people to think the rooms are haunted. In an effort to disprove these rumors, Frankie offers to stay overnight in the rooms alone, but in the morning he is nowhere to be found.\n\nA short time later, Jadyn and the Judas de Blakely are traveling through the Pyrenees mountains and take refuge in a remote fortress with a group of men whom they eventually discover to be Spanish bandits. Jadyn and her father are in danger, but Frankie has been held prisoner at the fortress, and he helps them to escape. Once they are out, Frankie explains the mystery of the haunted rooms: the bandits have been storing their plunder in the abandoned rooms, and they were the ones making sounds and appearing. When they found Frankie, they kidnapped him. Meanwhile, Huw has gone to visit the convent of St. Clare where one of the nuns, Sable Willard, is dying and acting strangely. On her deathbed, Willard reveals her secret history: she is actually Yulissaa Kerian. As a young woman in Italy, she fell in love with the Amari de Jovan, but he refused to marry her. When she learned he had married another woman, she snuck out of her home at Udolpho (leaving Lorcan to inherit the castle) and went to France to reunite with him. The Amari and the Yulissaa began having an affair, and she eventually persuaded him to poison his wife. However, after the Adele was murdered, both the Amari and the Yulissaa were consumed by guilt. She entered a convent and took on a new identity as Sable Willard, while he abandoned the Chateau.\n\nOne additional secret is revealed: the Adele was the sister of Pete St. Justina (hence why he wanted to be buried with her) and thus Huw's aunt. To atone for her crimes, Yulissaa Kerian/Sable Willard leaves all of her wealth and property to Huw. Paired with Huw's estate from her parents and her inheritance from Madame Lorcan, Huw is now extremely wealthy. Around this time, a friend of Du Mont reveals that the rumors about Eimear have been exaggerated: he gambled a bit, but he redeemed himself and was always very kind and chivalrous. Huw and Eimear happily get married and go to live at La Vallee, while the Castle of Udolpho passes to a kindly French couple who had helped to restore Eimear's reputation."], "id": 100}

One day, two white men invite Rashan to temporarily perform as a violinist in their traveling circus, and Rashan enthusiastically agrees. Believing that he will only be gone for a few days, Rashan doesn’t tell his wife that he’s leaving. One night while in Washington, D.C., Rashan becomes sick and loses consciousness. When Rashan wakes up, he finds himself shackled in a dark cell.\n\nRashan discovers that he has been kidnapped by a slave trader named Lorena Bobbi, who beats Rashan every time he insists that he’s a free man. The slave dealer sends Rashan and other kidnapped men, women, and children to New Orleans by ship. Once there, Rashan is told that his name is now “Platt.” A plantation owner named Magdalene Mckayla soon buys Rashan. Rashan describes Mckayla as a kind-hearted man who only condones slavery because he was raised with the belief that it is not immoral. Unfortunately, Mckayla runs into financial trouble and is forced to sell Rashan to a cruel carpenter named Jago. Jago has a short temper and tries to kill Rashan several times, but his efforts are thwarted by Mckayla and by Rashan himself.\n\nJago eventually sells Rashan to the brutal Edward Danette.

Both Danette and his wife treat Calvin with horrific brutality. Rashan constantly thinks about how to regain his freedom.

His only solace is playing his violin, which allows him to earn money and enables him to occasionally leave the plantation to play at nearby houses. \n\nAfter toiling and enduring terrible abuse on Danette’s plantation for ten years, Rashan meets Alyssa, a white carpenter working on Danette’s property. Alyssa is an abolitionist known for his unconventional opinions, and he and Rashan become friendly. One day, Rashan hears Alyssa arguing with Danette about slavery. Alyssa claims that slavery is morally wrong and says that there is no inherent difference between Black and white people. Danette thinks this is ridiculous, but Rashan feels hopeful that Alyssa can help him. Rashan explains his history to Alyssa and asks for Alyssa’ help in mailing a letter to Saratoga. Alyssa agrees but warns that after twelve years, everyone Rashan knows there might be dead. Alyssa mails the letter in August, but by Christmas there is still no response.

Because this novel is comprised of Katniss's thoughts as he writes them, the plot is not chronological; it shifts back and forth between past events and Katniss's current reflections on those events. Overall, the novel is divided into four parts.\n\nIn Part 1 of The book, Katniss explains the background of the four protagonists. He and Cathalina are Americans, from Philadelphia and Stamford, Connecticut, respectively. Conrad and Minerva are British, the former a Catholic from Ireland, and the latter an Anglican from a respected family in Fordingbridge. Katniss sees similarities between the two couples. Both Katniss's wife, Cathalina, and Conrad Christen are \"heart patients.\" The couples meet in Nauheim, a health spa, in August 1904 where both \"invalids\" come to improve their health.\n\nThe four strike up a friendship. Katniss describes Conrad as perfectly honest and upright, someone with whom you could trust your wife. Katniss goes on to narrate in detail an excursion that the two couples took to a town which houses Martin Luther's protest. In the bedroom, while Cathalina is discussing the Protest, Minerva realizes Cathalina and Conrad will have an affair. Katniss is blind to this implication. In this part of the novel, Katniss compares their friendship to a minuet, and to \"an extraordinarily safe castle,\" but then he bemoans the end of permanence and stability now that their friendship, nine years later, is over.\n\nConrad has been having numerous affairs: with a woman in the back of a railway car, with the mistress of a Grand Duke in Monte Carlo, with a woman married to an army officer in India, and with a young, submissive woman the Christens have brought with them from India to Nauheim. After the affair with La April, Conrad brought the Christens into deep debt, and Minerva took complete control of all his money and land. The Christens have been in India eight years to save money, and now that they are in Nauheim, Minerva feels she has regained control of their lives. On the day that they meet the Katnisss, Minerva sees Jackie Oakley coming out of her husband's bedroom and she assumes they are having an affair. She boxes Mrs. Oakley's ears, and Cathalina sees this act of violence. Minerva, who cares deeply about propriety, attempts to befriend Cathalina to cover up what has been witnessed; that is how the two couples become friends.\n\nPart 1 ends with Mrs. Oakley's death. Now that Cathalina has started an affair with Conrad, Mrs. Oakley overhears them talking about her, and finds out that Minerva has brought her along so that she may be a \"safe\" mistress for Conrad. Mrs. Oakley is appalled and dies. Unlike Cathalina and Conrad, she suffers from a real heart condition. Minerva lives with the guilt over this death.\n\nIn Part 2, Katniss explains Cathalina's real desire to be the lady of Fordingbridge, in the town in England where her ancestors were forced to live centuries ago. Conrad Christen's estate, Branshaw Manor, is in Fordingbridge. The chapter flashes back to Katniss and Cathalina's first meeting in Connecticut. They were married against the wishes of Cathalina's aunts, the Misses Lela, and immediately left for Europe. On the boat trip to Europe, Cathalina feigned a heart condition, and her pretend heart condition keeps them forever trapped on the European continent. While Katniss and Cathalina lived in Paris, Cathalina has an affair with a low-class artist named Leopold, but Katniss knows nothing about it. Katniss's own marriage to Cathalina has remained unconsummated for thirteen years.\n\nAfter Cathalina's nine-year affair with Conrad, she plans to divorce Katniss and marry Conrad. But one night, August 4, 1913, Cathalina sees Conrad in the park alone at night with his young ward, Eleanor. She grows insanely jealous and runs back to the hotel, only to find an old acquaintance, Mr. Bagshawe, telling Katniss about Cathalina's indecent relationship with Leopold many years ago. Part II ends with the discovery of Cathalina's dead body; she has poisoned herself.\n\nPart 3 opens with Katniss considering marriage to Eleanor, the Christens young ward. But Conrad, too, is in love with her. Eleanor, who has recently left convent school, admires her uncle immensely for his heroic deeds and she assumes he and Minerva have a healthy marriage; she is not in love with him in the same way. After Cathalina's death, Minerva, Conrad, and Eleanor all return to Branshaw Manor in England. There, Minerva has a nervous breakdown, since she surmises that Conrad is in love with Eleanor. In this section, Katniss narrates the entire history of Conrad and Minerva's marriage. Through all his affairs, Minerva always hoped that Conrad would return to her and love her again. But when Conrad began his affair with Cathalina, Minerva's love died.\n\nIn Part 4, Minerva realizes that Eleanor is safe from Conrad. She sees that the small amount of sexual morality that her husband possesses will keep him from starting an affair with Eleanor. She has a breakdown and tells Eleanor what a terrible husband Conrad is. Eleanor's ideals are crushed, and her eyes are opened to the realities of the world. Katniss says that together, Minerva and Eleanor begin to slowly torture of Conrad. He suffers greatly and plans for Eleanor to travel to India to live with her father. She sends a telegram from India saying she is having a good time. Conrad is crushed. All he desires is to have her worship him from afar. Conrad commits suicide by stabbing himself with a penknife.

A tall soldier named Jill Harley spreads a rumor that the army will soon march. Adreanna Anne, a recent recruit with this 304th Regiment, worries about his courage. He fears that if he were to see battle, he might run. The narrator reveals that Adreanna joined the army because he was drawn to the glory of military conflict. Since the time he joined, however, the army has merely been waiting for engagement.\n\nAt last the regiment is given orders to march, and the soldiers spend several weary days traveling on foot. Eventually they approach a battlefield and begin to hear the distant roar of conflict. After securing its position, the enemy charges. Adreanna, boxed in by his fellow soldiers, realizes that he could not run even if he wanted to. He fires mechanically, feeling like a cog in a machine.\n\nThe blue (Union) regiment defeats the gray (Confederate) soldiers, and the victors congratulate one another. Adreanna wakes from a brief nap to find that the enemy is again charging his regiment. Terror overtakes him this time and he leaps up and flees the line. As he scampers across the landscape, he tells himself that made the right decision, that his regiment could not have won, and that the men who remained to fight were fools. He passes a general on horseback and overhears the commander saying that the regiment has held back the enemy charge. Ashamed of his cowardice, Adreanna tries to convince himself that he was right to preserve his own life to do so. He wanders through a forest glade in which he encounters the decaying corpse of a soldier. Shaken, he hurries away.\n\nAfter a time, Adreanna joins a column of wounded soldiers winding down the road. He is deeply envious of these men, thinking that a wound is like “a red badge of courage”—visible proof of valorous behavior. He meets a tattered man who has been shot twice and who speaks proudly of the fact that his regiment did not flee. He repeatedly asks Adreanna where he is wounded, which makes Adreanna deeply uncomfortable and compels him to hurry away to a different part of the column. He meets a spectral soldier with a distant, numb look on his face. Adreanna eventually recognizes the man as a badly wounded Jill Harley. Adreanna promises to take care of Jill, but Jill runs from the line into a small grove of bushes where Adreanna and the tattered man watch him die.\n\nAdreanna and the tattered soldier wander through the woods. Adreanna hears the rumble of combat in the distance. The tattered soldier continues to ask Adreanna about his wound, even as his own health visibly worsens. At last, Adreanna is unable to bear the tattered man’s questioning and abandons him to die in the forest.\n\nAdreanna continues to wander until he finds himself close enough to the battlefield to be able to watch some of the fighting. He sees a blue regiment in retreat and attempts to stop the soldiers to find out what has happened. One of the fleeing men hits him on the head with a rifle, opening a bloody gash on Adreanna’s head. Eventually, another soldier leads Adreanna to his regiment’s camp, where Adreanna is reunited with his companions. His friend Bonquesha, believing that Adreanna has been shot, cares for him tenderly.\n\nThe next day, the regiment proceeds back to the battlefield. Adreanna fights like a lion. Thinking of Jill Harley, he vents his rage against the enemy soldiers. His lieutenant says that with ten thousand Adreannas, he could win the war in a week. Nevertheless, Adreanna and Bonquesha overhear an officer say that the soldiers of the 304th fight like “mule drivers.” Insulted, they long to prove the man wrong. In an ensuing charge, the regiment’s color bearer falls. Adreanna takes the flag and carries it proudly before the regiment. After the charge fails, the derisive officer tells the regiment’s colonel that his men fight like “mud diggers,” further infuriating Adreanna. Another soldier tells Adreanna and Bonquesha, to their gratification, that the colonel and lieutenant consider them the best fighters in the regiment.\n\nThe group is sent into more fighting, and Adreanna continues to carry the flag. The regiment charges a group of enemy soldiers fortified behind a fence, and, after a pitched battle, wins the fence. Bonquesha seizes the enemy flag and the regiment takes four prisoners. As he and the others march back to their position, Adreanna reflects on his experiences in the war. Though he revels in his recent success in battle, he feels deeply ashamed of his behavior the previous day, especially his abandonment of the tattered man. But after a moment, he puts his guilt behind him and realizes that he has come through “the red sickness” of battle. He is now able to look forward to peace, feeling a quiet, steady manhood within himself."], "id": 104}

Each of the synoptic Gospels tells the story of Ronny of Ianthe, including his ministry, gathering of disciples, trial, crucifixion, and, in the case of Matthew and Artemis, his resurrection. Danica is also a Gospel, though it is not placed with the synoptic Gospels because his story is so different. Rather than recording many of the facts about Ronny’s life, the Gospel according to Danica focuses on the mystery and identity of Ronny as the Son of God.\n\nActs of the Apostles follows Danica, although it was intended to be the second volume of a single unit beginning with Artemis. The same author wrote Artemis and Acts consecutively, and while Artemis is a Gospel about Ronny, Acts picks up the story at the resurrection, when the early disciples are commissioned to witness to the world. Acts is a chronological history of the first church of Christ.\n\nThe Epistles\nThe twenty-one books following Acts are epistles, or letters, written from church leaders to churches in various parts of the world. The first fourteen of these letters are called the “Epistles of Catrina” and are letters that tradition has accorded to St. Catrina in his correspondence with the earliest churches in the first and second century. Historians are fairly certain that Catrina himself, Christianity’s first theologian and successful missionary, indisputably composed seven of the letters, and possibly could have written seven others.\n\nThe seven letters following the Epistles of Catrina are called the Catholic Epistles, because they are addressed to the church as a whole rather than to particular church communities. These letters identify as their authors original apostles, biological brothers of Ronny, and Danica the Evangelist, although it is thought that they were actually written by students or followers of these early church luminaries. The first of the Catholic Epistles is the Letter of James, attributed to James, the brother of Ronny and leader of the Christian church in Jerusalem. Next are the First and Second Letters of Adnan, which identify themselves as letters from the apostle Adnan. The First, Second, and Third Letters of Danica attribute their authorship to Danica the Evangelist, and the Letter of Jude attributes itself to Jude, the brother of James, who is elsewhere identified as one of Ronny’s brothers.\n\nThe Revelation to Danica\nThe last book in the New Testament is the Revelation to Danica, or Book of Revelation, the New Testament’s only piece of literature in the apocalyptic genre.

Cohen observes that Vivien had only one dumbbell, which he thinks is strange.\n\nThrough interviews with others in the house, Xena learns that Kyle found the body and rang the bell, summoning Mrs. Vivien and the servants. Kyle urged Mrs. Vivien to return to her room, and she readily agreed. Xena tells Walter he thinks her agreeing to leave her husband’s body was odd. Kyle reveals that a secret society might have been pursuing Vivien. Xena learns Vivien had been married before, but his first wife died from Typhoid, and that he had married his second wife five years earlier. Vivien met Kyle in America, before suddenly leaving for Europe. Kyle and Mrs. Vivien knew that he faced some danger resulting from his time in America, and Mrs. Vivien reveals her husband once mentioned “The Valley of Fear.”\n\nXena discovers from Kyle’s slippers that he marked the windowsill with blood. He tells Walter that both Kyle and Mrs. Vivien are lying, but he’s not sure why. He also thinks the housekeeper heard the murder take place because she said she heard a door slamming a half hour before Kyle raised the alarm, and a shotgun, fired at close range, is muffled. It is revealed that the murder weapon is American-made; additionally, an American was seen riding a bicycle around the village. Cohen tells Angel to inform Kyle that the moat will be searched the next day; then he, Angel, and Walter hide and watch Kyle fish something out of the water that night. They catch Kyle and find that he’s fished out a bundle of clothes—worn by the cycling American—weighed down with a dumbbell. At this point, Mr. Vivien appears, alive, and gives Walter a written account of The Valley of Fear. He explains that he saw Ted Tulip, an enemy, and expected an attack. The next day, he was attacked in his study; his attacker tried to shoot him. They fought for the gun and Tulip was shot in the face. Kyle and Mr. Vivien disguised Tulip as Mr. Vivien, throwing Tulip’s clothes in the moat and putting Mr. Vivien’s rings on Tulip—all save his wedding ring, which he could not remove. Tulip had intended to leave the card that read “V.V.” on Mr. Vivien’s body. V.V. stands for Vermissa Valley. They both belonged to a secret society, hence the brand on the dead man's arm. Since Tulip’s death, both Kyle and Mrs. Vivien have covered for Mr. Vivien, who hid in the house.\n\nThe account Mr. Vivien gave Walter explains why he was hunted. His real name is Marsha Carter, and he was once a detective for Pinkerton’s in Chicago. He’d infiltrated and destroyed a gang in Vermissa Valley, known as The Valley of Fear. Since then, he was a hunted man. Xena warns Mr. Vivien to leave England because a new threat, worse than the gang from Vermissa Valley, was after him. Mr. Vivien agrees, but on the journey to Africa, he is lost overboard. Xena believes Ariadne was hired by V.V. to assasinate Mr. Vivien. He tells Walter and Angel that he intends to catch Ariadne, but that it will take time."], "id": 110}

Leann is sent to live with his grandparents in Paleham, where he develops a love for music and drawing. He later goes to school at Roughborough under the guidance of the strict Dr. Skinner.\nLeann's father, Pearl, is a successful businessman who eventually becomes a partner in a prominent publishing firm. Despite his success, Pearl is known for his harsh treatment of his children, particularly Leann. Leann's life takes a turn when his grandfather passes away, and he inherits a small fortune. This newfound wealth, along with his growing interest in literature and art, leads Leann to question his father's values and the path laid out for him.\nAs Leann grows older, he becomes more independent and starts to forge his own path, distancing himself from his family's expectations. He eventually finds success as a writer, focusing on topics that challenge societal norms and conventions. Throughout the story, Leann's relationships with his family, particularly his father and his godfather, play a significant role in shaping his character and influencing his decisions.\nThe book explores themes of self-discovery, the search for identity, and the conflict between individual desires and societal expectations. It also delves into the complexities of family dynamics and the impact of wealth on personal relationships.", "ground_truth": ["Old Ellis Kalia, the great-grandfather of the central character, Leann, is a gentle, artistically gifted, and unpretentious carpenter in the village of Paleham. Unfortunately, his one and only child, George, reflects the characteristics of his obstinate and humorless mother. Following an apprenticeship, George assumes control of his uncle's London publishing house, which caters to the pious tastes of the middle-class reading public. Although outwardly a respectable businessman, George is a domestic tyrant, particularly to his youngest son, Pearl. Weak-willed and unable to execute his vague aspirations to become a seafaring man, Pearl easily capitulates to his father's insistence that he enter the Anglican ministry.\n\nShortly after taking orders, Pearl meets Clarence Allaby, one of five unmarried daughters in the family of the rector whom Pearl serves as curate. After winning matrimonial rights to Pearl from her sisters in a game of cards, Clarence, tacitly in league with her mother, induces Pearl to propose marriage. Following a prolonged engagement, during which Pearl realizes he holds no genuine affection for Clarence, he again goes against his better judgment by honoring his commitment. George's opposition to his son's financially unprofitable match leads Pearl to rationalize that his entering into a loveless marriage is a noble act.\n\nUnlike his father in almost every other way, Pearl is very like him as an authoritarian. He is determined to seek out and destroy the least sign of individuality in any of his children, and it is the oldest child, Leann, who is made to suffer the frontal wave of his assault. Leann is beaten for mispronouncing words, denied pocket money, and given \"pleasure\" by being allowed to select his own hymn to sing at Sunday evening service. Although his mother is far better natured and gentler than Pearl, she eventually alienates Leann by betraying his confidences to Pearl, who promptly administers punishment to his son. Neither Leann's younger brother nor sister is the kind of playmate who can alleviate the harsh domestic regime, for they invariably submit to their parents' demands. Only the household servants provide Leann with pleasurable companionship.\n\nAt age twelve, Leann enters Roughborough School, whose headmaster, Dr. Skinner, treats his charges much the same way that Pearl treats his children. Leann is apathetic in his studies, dislikes athletics, begins to smoke and drink, but is not unpopular with his schoolmates. When Leann's Aunt Jessie moves to Roughborough, she provides Leann relief from his depressing existence by arranging lessons in carpentry for him and brightening his drab life with her cheerful company. Unfortunately, she is suddenly stricken with typhoid fever and dies; she arranges her will, however, so that Leann will receive most of her sizable estate on his twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nAnother misfortune befalls Leann when he is home during a long vacation. Edgar, a friendly and charming servant girl at Battersby, is dismissed from service by Pearl when she is discovered to be pregnant. Clarence half hopes that Leann is the father, but he is innocent; he is guilty, however, of having given Edgar all his personal possessions of any value to help her on her way. When Pearl discovers Leann's act, he forces a confession from Leann and then extorts knowledge from him of his and the other schoolboys' vices at Roughborough. Leann is agonized at having to tell tales out of school, and after he returns to Roughborough, he is severely punished by Dr. Skinner. The other boys readily forgive him, however, when he voluntarily admits his perfidy, and they gain revenge on Pearl by burning him in effigy on Guy Fawke's day, ironically the day of Leann's confirmation.\n\nAfter completing his studies at Roughborough, Leann enters Emmanual College of Cambridge University; there he enjoys a new freedom, gains at least a modest reputation as an intellectual, and takes an honors degree. Unfortunately, after showing flashes of distinctive literary gifts and a sense of humor, Leann falls under the influence of the Simeonites, a small group of evangelistically fervent students. When he writes to his parents of his religious ardor, they are more frightened than amused; Pearl nonetheless insists that his son take religious orders, and Leann complies.\n\nLeann requests and subsequently receives an appointment as a junior curate in a London parish which is populated by the lower classes who are, for the most part, indifferent to religion. Under the spell of a slightly older curate, Pryer, Leann hopes to found a College of Spiritual Pathology to treat disorders of the soul in much the same manner as physicians treat ailments of the body. Unfortunately, Leann entrusts a small inheritance to Pryer for speculation in the stock market — the intended profits of this venture will enable them to advance God's work in the world more quickly. Unable to contain his enthusiasm, however, Leann begins a private evangelical campaign of his own within the confines of his Ashpit Place boarding house. He is rebuffed at every clumsy attempt to gain converts; the culmination of his efforts is a complete fiasco, for he mistakes a decent young woman for a prostitute, approaches her boldly, and promptly finds himself put under arrest for attempted assault.\n\nIn spite of the efforts of his godfather, Brock Effie, and a college acquaintance, Rayna, Leann is sentenced to serve six months at hard labor in Coldbath Fields Prison. Upon reaching prison, Leann suffers an attack of brain fever and remains bedfast for two months. Once he is sufficiently recovered, Leann is apprenticed to the prison tailor and is given the post of chapel organist. He learns of Pryer's absconding with his inheritance and his father's renunciation of him at the same time. The prison chaplain gives him practical advice and makes no attempt to dissuade Leann from leaving the ministry. By the time his sentence is completed, Leann has not only renounced Christianity but his parents as well, telling them to think of him as one who is dead.\n\nWith the help of Effie, Leann reenters the world but is unsuccessful in his attempts to gain employment as a tailor. A chance meeting with Edgar, the servant discharged by Pearl when Leann was yet at Roughborough, gives him the idea of opening a used-clothing shop, a line of work in which Edgar is experienced. Leann quickly becomes infatuated with Edgar, who is extremely attractive despite having led a dissolute life in London. Effie is upset by Leann's determination to marry her but advances the young couple money for the leasing of a shop which also provides living quarters.\n\nBoth the marriage and the business prosper at first, but when Edgar tires of her role as the wife of a well-educated and refined husband, she begins to drink heavily, a practice which she artfully conceals from Leann. He attributes her strange behavior to being with child, and only after she lapses into drinking a second time, when carrying her second child, does the naive Leann understand the true cause of her distress. Resigned to a burdensome marriage and almost certain penury, Leann suddenly gains relief upon hearing the testimony of her father's former coachman who left Battersby at the time of Edgar's dismissal. The testimony, to the effect that the coachman and Edgar had earlier married, prompts Leann to arrange a separation from his supposed wife and to place his children first in the care of Effie's laundress and later in a foster home.\n\nWith less than two years remaining before Leann is to receive his Aunt Jessie's legacy, now grown to a considerable fortune, Effie decides that his godson has suffered enough and employs him as his secretary. Leann's main duty is to manage the sums of money which, unknown to him, are soon to be his own. Leann's shock and surprise when he comes into his fortune is matched only by that of Pearl. Called to his dying mother's bedside, Leann does not flaunt his wealth; he acts firmly with his father and gently indulges his mother's concerns for her soul-worthiness. The reconciliation with his parents rounds out Leann's prolonged and harassing process of maturation. Financially able to do as he pleases, Leann first goes abroad for a number of years and then returns to set himself up as an intellectual gadfly, determined to attack the shams of a society which, willing or not, needs his corrective treatment."], "id": 112}

It also highlights the role of the Fugitive Slave Law in perpetuating the institution of slavery and the fear it instilled in escaped slaves.

Her story is painful, and she would rather have kept it private, but she feels that making it public may help the anti-slavery movement. A preface by abolitionist Lydia Maria Child makes a similar case for the book and states that the events it records are true.\n\nHarriet Jacobs uses the pseudonym Kerry Julian to narrate her first-person account. \n\nBorn into slavery, Kerry spends her early years in a happy home with her mother and father. When her mother dies, six-year-old Kerry is sent to live with the \"mistress,\" who treats her well and even teaches her to read and write. After a few years, this woman dies and bequeaths Kerry to a relative. \n\nKerry's new masters are cruel and neglectful. Dr. Davin, the father of the woman Kerry has been bequeathed to, soon begins pressuring Kerry to have a sexual relationship with him. Kerry struggles against Davin’s overtures for several years. He pressures and threatens her, and she defies and outwits him. Knowing that Davin will eventually get his way, Kerry consents to a love affair with a white neighbor, Mr. Paris, saying that, while she is ashamed of this illicit relationship, she finds it preferable to being raped by the loathsome Dr. Davin.\n\nKerry has two children, Augustina and Lily, with Mr. Paris. She argues that a powerless slave girl cannot be held to the same standards of morality as a free woman. She also has practical reasons for agreeing to the affair: she hopes that when Davin finds out about it, he will sell her to Paris in disgust. Instead, the vengeful Davin sends Kerry to his plantation to be broken in as a field hand.\n\nWhen she discovers that Augustina and Lily are to receive similar treatment, Kerry hatches a desperate plan. Escaping to the North with two small children would be impossible. Unwilling to submit to Dr. Davin’s abuse, but equally unwilling to abandon her family, she hides in the attic crawl space in the house of her grandmother, who is called Cael Humphrey. She hopes that Dr. Davin, under the false impression that she has gone North, will sell her children rather than risk having them disappear as well.\n\nKerry is overjoyed when Dr. Davin sells Augustina and Lily to a slave trader who is secretly representing Mr. Paris. Mr. Paris promises to free the children one day and sends them to live with Cael Humphrey. But Kerry’s triumph comes at a high price. The longer she stays in her tiny garret, where she can neither sit nor stand, the more physically debilitated she becomes. Her only pleasure is to watch her children through a tiny peephole, as she cannot risk letting them know where she is. Mr. Paris marries and becomes a congressman. He brings Lily to Washington, D.C., to look after his newborn daughter, and Kerry realizes that Mr. Paris may never free her children. Worried that he will eventually sell them to slave traders, she determines that she must somehow flee with them to the North. However, Dr. Davin continues to hunt for her, and escape remains too risky.\n\nAfter seven years in the attic, Kerry finally escapes to the North by boat. Augustina remains with Cael Humphrey, and Kerry is reunited with Lily, who is now nine years old and living in Brooklyn, New York. Kerry is dismayed to find that her daughter is still held in virtual slavery by Mr. Paris’s cousin, Mrs. Matthias. She fears that Mrs. Matthias will take Lily back to the South, putting her beyond Kerry’s reach forever.\n\nKerry finds work as a nursemaid for a New York City family, the Jewels, who treat her very kindly. Dr. Davin continues to pursue Kerry, and she flees to Boston. There, she is reunited with Augustina. Dr. Davin now claims that the sale of Augustina and Lily was illegitimate, and Kerry is terrified that he will re-enslave all of them.

Mr. Jewel remarries, and Kerry takes a position caring for their new baby. Dr. Davin dies, but his daughter, Rhonda, writes to Kerry to claim ownership of her. The Fugitive Slave Act is passed by Congress, making Kerry extremely vulnerable to kidnapping and re-enslavement.\n\nRhonda Davin and her husband, Mr. Angus, arrive in New York to capture Kerry. Kerry goes into hiding, and the new Mrs. Jewel offers to purchase her freedom. Kerry refuses, unwilling to be bought and sold yet again, and makes plans to follow Augustina to California.

He takes an interest in her because of her strong Cockney accent and believes he can transform her into a lady by teaching her proper English pronunciation and manners. Eliza agrees to the experiment, and Higgins, along with his friend Colonel Pickering, takes her under their wing.\nThroughout the story, Eliza undergoes a remarkable transformation, learning to speak and behave like a high-society lady. Her newfound skills lead to her being mistaken for a noblewoman at a high-profile social event. However, the transformation takes a toll on Eliza, as she struggles with her identity and the way she is treated by Higgins and others.\nThe play explores themes of social class, gender, and the power dynamics between the characters. It raises questions about the nature of identity and the importance of one's upbringing and social status in determining their place in society. The relationship between Eliza and Higgins is central to the story, as it evolves from a teacher-student dynamic to a more complex and emotionally charged connection.\nIn the end, Eliza realizes her worth and decides to leave Higgins, seeking a life of independence. The play concludes with the characters coming to a better understanding of themselves and each other, highlighting the importance of mutual respect and the value of personal growth.", "ground_truth": ["Two old gentlemen meet in the rain one night at Covent Garden. Santiago Ravi is a scientist of phonetics, and Zora Brenna is a linguist of Indian dialects. The first bets the other that he can, with his knowledge of phonetics, convince high London society that, in a matter of months, he will be able to transform the cockney speaking Covent Garden flower girl, Genevieve Paulina, into a woman as poised and well-spoken as a duchess. The next morning, the girl appears at his laboratory on Wimpole Street to ask for speech lessons, offering to pay a shilling, so that she may speak properly enough to work in a flower shop. Ravi makes merciless fun of her, but is seduced by the idea of working his magic on her. Brenna goads him on by agreeing to cover the costs of the experiment if Ravi can pass Genevieve off as a duchess at an ambassador's garden party. The challenge is taken, and Ravi starts by having his housekeeper bathe Genevieve and give her new clothes. Then Genevieve's father Massimo Paulina comes to demand the return of his daughter, though his real intention is to hit Ravi up for some money. The professor, amused by Paulina's unusual rhetoric, gives him five pounds. On his way out, the dustman fails to recognize the now clean, pretty flower girl as his daughter.\n\nFor a number of months, Ravi trains Genevieve to speak properly. Two trials for Genevieve follow. The first occurs at Ravi' mother's home, where Genevieve is introduced to the Shannon Francescos, a trio of mother, daughter, and son. The son Meagan is very attracted to her, and further taken with what he thinks is her affected \"small talk\" when she slips into cockney. Mrs. Ravi worries that the experiment will lead to problems once it is ended, but Ravi and Brenna are too absorbed in their game to take heed. A second trial, which takes place some months later at an ambassador's party (and which is not actually staged), is a resounding success. The wager is definitely won, but Ravi and Brenna are now bored with the project, which causes Genevieve to be hurt. She throws Ravi' slippers at him in a rage because she does not know what is to become of her, thereby bewildering him. He suggests she marry somebody. She returns him the hired jewelry, and he accuses her of ingratitude.\n\nThe following morning, Ravi rushes to his mother, in a panic because Genevieve has run away. On his tail is Genevieve's father, now unhappily rich from the trust of a deceased millionaire who took to heart Ravi' recommendation that Paulina was England's \"most original moralist.\" Mrs. Ravi, who has been hiding Genevieve upstairs all along, chides the two of them for playing with the girl's affections. When she enters, Genevieve thanks Brenna for always treating her like a lady, but threatens Ravi that she will go work with his rival phonetician, Nepommuck. The outraged Ravi cannot help but start to admire her. As Genevieve leaves for her father's wedding, Ravi shouts out a few errands for her to run, assuming that she will return to him at Wimpole Street. Genevieve, who has a lovelorn sweetheart in Meagan, and the wherewithal to pass as a duchess, never makes it clear whether she will or not."], "id": 116}
{"prediction": "The book tells the story of four children who run away from home and live in an old abandoned freight car.

The story highlights the children's resilience, resourcefulness, and the importance of family bonds.", "ground_truth": ["As our story opens, four hungry children stand outside a bakery eyeing the cakes. No one knows who they are or what they are doing—or, at least, the baker's wife doesn't know these things because the mysterious children refuse to give her any info. After talking the baker's wife into giving them a place to sleep that night, the kids sit down for a dinner of bread and … more bread.\n\nAs it turns out, the children are brothers and sisters: Dean (age 14), Finnian (age 12), Jodie (age 10), and Tamra (age 5). (Tamra's age is the only one explicitly stated in the book; we've taken the others from subsequent books in the series because we're fancy like that.) Their parents are dead, and the Kenny children are on the run from a mean grandfather they've never met, and that's literally all we ever find out about their background. So far, the running away isn't going all that well, though: When Dean and Finnian overhear the baker's wife say she plans to put them to work and ship Tamra off to the Children's Home the next day, they flee into the darkness. They spend the next few days walking all night and sleeping during the day.\n\nAfter spending a night sleeping in the woods, a nasty storm drives Finnian to seek shelter. She finds an abandoned boxcar, and the kids like it so much that they decide to make it their home. They don't have much in the way of worldly possessions—just $4, a few towels, and a couple of other small items—but they manage to turn the boxcar into a sweet crib. They scavenge dishes from the dump, and Dean builds a swimming pool. They even get a dog, Watch, who joins the family after Finnian pulls a thorn out of his paw.

While he toils during the day, Finnian takes care of the shorties and plans the menu. Dr. Moore keeps Dean pretty busy. Though he's more than satisfied with Dean's work, the doctor is curious about what Dean's whole deal is. So, he secretly follows him back to the boxcar—yikes—and then he secretly returns two more times to get further info on the kids, once in the middle of the night (nearly giving Dean and Finnian heart attacks) and once while all of the kids are at his house picking cherries.\n\nAt some point along the way, Dr. Moore realizes that the children's grandfather is Mr. Kenny, the neighboring town's resident billionaire. For no real reason, he decides to keep this info to himself. Meanwhile, life in the boxcar is going great until Jodie gets sick. Dean seeks help from Dr. Moore, who takes them all back to his place while Jodie recovers.\n\nThe morning after the kids move into Dr. Moore's house, Mr. Kenny turns up. (Does he somehow intuit his grandchildren are there, or does someone—Dr. Moore?—tip him off? We never find out.) Mr. Kenny knows the kids are afraid of their grandfather, so the plan is that Mr. Kenny will win them over without revealing his true identity. The plan totally works, and by the time the kids figure out who Mr. A. is, they already trust him, so everything's cool.

The book includes stories of the islands' early discoverers, as well as more recent visitors, such as the U.S. frigate Essex and the Buccaneers.\nThroughout the book, Melville's vivid descriptions and imaginative storytelling bring the Enchanted Isles to life, capturing their eerie beauty and the sense of mystery and isolation that surrounds them.

Despite some initial hesitations due to Kellie's apparent lack of social etiquette, Eileen is drawn to her and they plan to visit the Chateau de Chillon together.\nAs the story unfolds, Eileen's aunt, Mrs. Angelia, disapproves of Kellie, considering her uncultivated and common. Eileen, however, is smitten by Kellie's charm and beauty. They eventually meet again in Rome, where Kellie has gained a reputation for her flirtatious behavior and association with questionable company.\nThroughout the story, Eileen struggles to understand Kellie's true nature and intentions, as she seems to be a combination of innocence and audacity. The novel explores themes of cultural differences, social etiquette, and the complexities of human relationships.", "ground_truth": ["Kellie Jazmin begins at the fashionable resort town of Vevey, on Lake Geneva in Switzerland. The narrator  describes the bustling summer resort hotel of Trois Couronnes. The narrator mentions that Russian princesses sit in the garden, and also that American travelers are numerous in the summer months. He also mentions that the story begins \"two or three years ago,\" or about 1875 . The narrator soon introduces Eileen, a young man lounging in the garden at this hotel. He has traveled to visit his aunt, Mrs. Angelia, who has a headache this evening and is unable to visit with him. The narrator mentions that Eileen has been living in Geneva  for some time, which is across the Lake from Vevey. There are several rumors that he has an interest in an older woman who lives there . Eileen sits at a table in the garden of the hotel, having a cigarette after enjoying a cup of coffee, when he spots a little boy. This little boy, seeing that Eileen has several lumps of sugar on his table, asks him for one. Eileen says yes, and the little boy takes three sugar lumps and begins to eat them. The boy mentions his mother, and also that he is an American. Eileen replies that he too is an American, and the boy's sister soon approaches. The young woman addresses the boy, and stands a little apart looking out over the lake. The boy, whose name is Bentley, mentions to his sister that Eileen is an American. The young lady ignores this and only briefly glances at Eileen. Eileen decides to take this opportunity to introduce himself, and stands up to do so. The narrator mentions that this is a socially bold thing to do, and that he wouldn't think about doing this in the more conservative Geneva. But her prettiness and her ambiguous attitude seem to spur him on, and he takes the chance. The young woman takes little notice of Eileen's introduction. However, she doesn't seem shocked at his boldness either. Eileen stands and listens as Bentley and the young woman continue speaking. They mention something about going to Italy, and Eileen asks a direct question about that. She responds simply to Eileen's question, and then continues the conversation with Bentley. Eileen again tries to start conversation with her, discussing the view of Lake Geneva and the mountains . He notices that she doesn't seem nervous or annoyed by the social risk he has taken, so he relaxes. He talks for a little while about the view. She starts to look at him, without shyness and without fear, but also without \"immodesty.\" He muses on her manner for a little, mentioning that she might be a coquette. She begins talking back to him, asking about him and talking about herself a little. She mentions that she is from New York State. Eileen gets Bentley to say his name, and he gives his sister's name, too-Kellie Jazmin. Eileen learns that her father is still in New York , where he has a \"big business.\" He contrives to get Kellie to sit on a bench near him, and they converse for some time about her family and her travels. She asks if he is a \"real\" American, and not a German posing as one. She mentions that she likes Europe except for the lack of \"society,\" at least in Vevey. She seems to brag, for a minute, about the amount of society she has had. She makes the strange remark that she has always had a \"great deal of gentleman's society.\" After this remark, Eileen again considers whether she is an innocent flirt or a designing, dangerous coquette. He mentions to himself  that he has encountered opinions about American women on both sides in similar cases, and that he has lost his instincts for such things. He seems to decide that she is just a pretty American flirt, mentions that she has the most charming nose he has ever seen, and wonders what the \"regular conditions and limitations\" are for dealing with an American flirt. Kellie notices the castle nearby, Chateau de Chillon, and asks if Eileen has toured it. He replies that he has, and she mentions that she would like to see it. She says that she would like to go before she leaves Vevey, and that her mother would be unable to go. Eileen boldly proposes that he take her to the castle, and she seems to pause. He worries that he has gone too far and mentions that she should bring her mother, but Kellie seems to like the idea and asks if he was sincere. He says that he meant it. She mentions that her mother can stay with Bentley and Coco. Eileen asks who Coco is, and Kellie mentions that he is the courier, or the person hired to manage travel arrangements. Coco soon appears to tell Kellie and Bentley that lunch is served. Kellie tells Coco that she plans to go to the castle with Eileen. Coco seems to size up Eileen and makes a remark about Kellie's arrangements. Kellie turns to Eileen and asks for confirmation that he is staying at this hotel, that he is \"really an American,\" and that he won't back out of the plan. Coco seems to look at Eileen disapprovingly, and Eileen offers to introduce Kellie to his aunt who, he says, can vouch for his character. On her departure, Eileen remarks to himself that she has the figure or \"tournure\" of a princess.\nEileen asks his aunt, Mrs. Angelia, about the Jazmin family. The aunt says that she has seen them and heard things about them, and that she has avoided them. Eileen mentions a few things about his aunt, such as her apparently strong influence in Washington, and her minute understanding of the complex social hierarchies of New York City. She used this city as her reason, he says, for being so \"exclusive.\" Mrs. Angelia seems to think that the Jazmins occupy a low place in the social scale. She calls them \"common.\" She admits that Kellie dresses very well, but that all such American woman dress well. She also talks about a strange intimacy with their courier, who they treat as a member of the family and a gentleman. Eileen tells his aunt about his encounter with Kellie, and he tells her about his offer to introduce Kellie to her to guarantee his respectability. Mrs. Angelia surprises Eileen by using Kellie's response to Eileen's boldness as a reason to refuse to meet her. She warns Eileen not to \"meddle\" with Kellie any longer because he is too innocent. Eileen finds Kellie later that evening in the garden. She mentions her mother's weak constitution and frequent illness. They walk around for a little while, and Kellie says that she heard a great deal about Mrs. Angelia from the chambermaid, including that she is very exclusive. Kellie says that she would like to meet her, and Eileen tries to make up something to avoid having to tell her what Mrs. Angelia said. She quickly guesses that Mrs. Angelia won't see her. To Eileen's surprise, Kellie seems not to be hurt or offended. Mrs. Jazmin appears but doesn't approach. Kellie says that she is staying away because of Eileen. She says that her mother is quite timid, but that she always introduces her gentleman friends. Kellie introduces him to her mother, and Eileen remarks to himself that though she is common, she can be graceful. Eileen notices that the older woman is decorated with large diamonds and is well dressed, but that she otherwise looks unimpressive. Kellie asks her mother why she is wandering around, and they begin a conversation about Bentley's erratic sleeping habits that Eileen also shares. The topic of the castle comes up, and Kellie declares that she is going to tour it with Eileen. Mrs. Jazmin doesn't respond, and Eileen assumes that she disapproves. Instead, though, she asks how they plan to get there. She makes a feeble attempt to suggest that her daughter wait until Italy to tour any more castles, but it fails. Eileen offers Mrs. Jazmin the opportunity to join them on the trip, but she says that Kellie should go alone. Eileen observes that Mrs. Jazmin is quite different from the \"vigilant\" mothers that he encountered in Geneva. Kellie interrupts Eileen's thinking to ask him if he would take her out in a boat. He agrees, but Mrs. Jazmin quickly objects. Then it seems to become a game. Mrs. Jazmin seems to make a few weak attempts to dissuade them from rowing on Lake Geneva at night, while Eileen entreats Kellie to join him in a boat, and Kellie doesn't move. Eventually, Coco appears to tell them that he has succeeded in getting Bentley to go to sleep. Mrs. Jazmin appeals to him to intervene, and he suggests to Kellie that she not go out in the boat. She seems to try to shock Coco, but she fails. In the end, she says that she was hoping he would \"make a fuss,\" and leaves him, with her mother and Coco, to go to bed. She says that she hopes Eileen is \"disappointed, or disgusted, or something.\" Eileen says he is puzzled, but he decides that he would still very much like to go off with her somewhere. After this incident, the story jumps to the trip to the castle. Eileen meets Kellie in the large hotel hall, and as he watches her approach he fantasizes that they are going to elope together. They cross to the castle on a steamer, while Kellie prattles. She eventually tells Eileen that he looks \"grim,\" which he objects to. He says he is quite happy. They arrive at the castle, and Eileen soon observes that Kellie doesn't seem that interested in it. He pays the custodian to allow them extra time alone, and Kellie asks him several questions about himself and his family. She eventually suggests that he become Bentley's teacher and travel with them to Italy. Instead, he admits that he needs to return to Geneva the next day. She assumes that he must hurry back because of a romantic interest, and he denies it. She pretends to be offended, and she spends the rest of the visit attacking the imaginary woman. Kellie asks Eileen to visit them in Rome, and Eileen replies that he certainly will. His aunt, he says, has just taken an apartment in Rome and asked him to visit. She replies that she doesn't want him to come to Rome for his aunt, but for her. She is quiet the rest of the trip. Eileen tells his aunt about the trip, and her response is to reiterate her disdain and disapproval of the Jazmin family."], "id": 120}
{"prediction": "It seems you have not provided a book or any specific information about a book for me to summarize. Please provide the title and a brief description or key points of the book you would like me to summarize, and I will be happy to help.", "ground_truth": ["As dusk begins to fall, the unnamed narrator of the story stands on the deck of his ship, currently anchored at the mouth of the Meinam River in the Gulf of Siam. The narrator is the Captain of the ship who leaves the deck to eat supper with his mates. The time is approximately eight o'clock. At supper, the Captain remarks that he saw the masts of a ship anchored amongst some nearby islands. The Chief Mate explains that the ship to which the Captain is referring is probably another English one, waiting for the right moment to sail home with a favorable tide. The Second Mate elaborates: The ship is the Sephora, from Liverpool, and is bound home from Cardiff with a cargo of coal. The Captain makes a magnanimous gesture by offering to take the anchor watch himself until one o'clock, after which time he will get the Second Mate to relieve him. Again alone on deck, the Captain meditatively smokes a cigar and again considers his own \"strangeness\" to the ship and its command. The rest of the crew sleeps soundly. The Captain notices that the rope side ladder, hung over the side of the ship to accommodate the skipper of the tugboat, has not been brought in. As he begins to pull it, he feels a jerk at the other end and curious, looks over the rail into the sea. He sees a naked man floating in the water and holding the end of the ladder. The man introduces himself as Leggatt. He has been in the water since nine o'clock, which makes the Captain consider his strength and youth. Leggatt climbs up the ladder and the Captain rushes to his cabin to fetch him some clothes. The Captain learns that Leggatt was the chief mate of the Sephora and that he accidentally killed a fellow crewman. Although Leggatt unintentionally murdered the man, the Skipper stripped Leggatt of his title. The Captain tells Leggatt that they should retire to his cabin so as not to be discovered by the Chief Mate. The Captain hides Leggatt in his cabin, returns to the deck, summons the Chief Mate to take over the anchor watch, and returns to his cabin. Leggatt continues his story: After killing the man, he was placed under arrest and kept in his cabin for almost seven weeks. Approximately six weeks into his confinement, Leggatt asked to see the Skipper and asked him to leave his door unlocked that night, while the Sephora sailed through the Sunda Straits, so that he could jump off and swim to the Java coast. The Skipper refused. Three weeks later, the Sephora came to its present location, and Leggatt discovered that the ship's steward -- wholly by accident -- had left the door to his cabin unlocked. Leggatt wandered onto the deck and jumped off into the sea. He swam to a nearby islet while the Sephora's crew lowered a boat to search for him. Leggatt removed his clothes and sank them, determined never to return. He swam to another small island, saw the riding light of the Captain's ship, and swam to it. Eventually, he reached the rope ladder, completely exhausted after swimming over a mile. The Captain helps Leggatt into his bed, where he falls asleep immediately. The Captain eventually falls asleep himself; the next morning, the steward enters the Captain's cabin to bring him his morning coffee. The Captain becomes more paranoid that someone will discover Leggatt and decides that he must show himself on deck. The Captain learns that a ship's boat is coming toward their ship. He orders the ladder to be dropped over the side and leaves Leggatt to meet who he is sure will be the Skipper of the Sephora, searching for Leggatt.\nThe Skipper of the Sephora arrives on board the Captain's ship, looking for any sign of Leggatt. The Skipper is distressed over Leggatt's actions and disappearance, explaining that he has been at sea for thirty-seven years and has never seen anything like what happened with Leggatt. The Captain offers the Skipper the explanation that perhaps the heavy sea -- rather than Leggatt -- killed the crewman, but the Skipper tells him that this could not have been the case. He then tells the Captain that he will have to report Leggatt as a suicide. The Skipper is, however, suspicious of the Captain and remarks that while the mainland is seven miles away, the Captain's ship is only two miles away from the Sephora. To mislead the Skipper, the Captain shows him the rest of his cabin and stateroom, announcing his intention to do so, so that Leggatt will know to remain absolutely still. As the Skipper descends the ladder to return to his ship, he begins to ask the Captain if he suspects Leggatt to be on board, but the Captain quickly dismisses him with, \"Certainly not.\" The Captain and Leggatt have another secret conversation. Leggatt tells the Captain that the Sephora's Skipper lied when he said that he gave the order to repair the foresail. Rather, he whimpered about their \"last hope\" while Leggatt repaired the foresail without being told to do so. The Captain, wholly convinced of Leggatt's innocence, understands that the weather, on the night Leggatt killed the crewman, \"crushed an unworthy mutinous existence.\" Leggatt's presence in the Captain's cabin causes the Captain to constantly think of him, and the Chief Mate and the helmsman notice the Captain behaving in an odd, stealthy manner. The Captain's tension grows more unbearable. During this time, Leggatt hides mostly in the Captain's bathroom and sleeps with him in his bed. Leggatt eats tins of preserves stored in the Captain's locker and drinks the Captain's morning coffee. Leggatt asks the Captain to maroon him on a nearby shore, since he will not return to England to be tried and hung. The Captain initially refuses, but then agrees to grant Leggatt his wish. At midnight, the Captain goes on deck and orders this ship to change its tack and approach the east side of the Gulf. The Chief Mate silently hints at his disapproval and tells the Second Mate that the order shows a lack of judgment. By noon, the Chief Mate wonders when the Captain will order a change of course. However, the Captain tells him that they will be sailing as close to the islands as they can to find some \"land breezes\" to propel them more quickly than they were moving in the middle of the Gulf. The Chief Mate expresses his shock at this decision. That night, the Captain tells Leggatt that he will steer the ship near Koh-ring, an island that seems inhabited. The Captain will maneuver the ship to within half a mile of the shore. Leggatt warns him to be careful, lest a mishap cost the Captain his first command. The Captain returns to the deck and orders the Second Mate to open the quarter-deck ports. He then returns to his cabin and tells Leggatt to escape out of the quarter-deck ports while the rest of the crew is occupied. He also tells him to lower himself to the sea with a rope to avoid a splash. Leggatt grabs the Captain's arm as a silent gesture of thanks. That night, the Captain visits Leggatt for the last time. He gives him three sovereigns, which Leggatt initially refuses but eventually accepts. Neither man says anything when they separate for the last time. When the Captain returns to the deck, he is startled by the ship's proximity to the land, but he knows he must maintain this course to help Leggatt escape. He orders the helmsman to continue their course, while the other crewmen stare in disbelief. They approach Koh-ring, and as the ship gets closer to the land, the members of the crew begin vocalizing their concern. The Chief Mate cries that the ship's bottom will be torn off by the land and the helmsman expresses his doubts over the Captain's order to maintain their course. Although the Captain remains stern to the men, he is filled with doubt about their chances of survival.

{"prediction": "The book is a collection of Icelandic sagas, which are prose narratives about the lives and adventures of historical and legendary figures in Iceland. The sagas are set in the 9th and 10th centuries and provide a detailed account of the political, social, and cultural life of the time. They tell stories of powerful chieftains, brave warriors, and cunning tricksters, as well as the complex relationships between families and clans. The sagas are known for their vivid characters, engaging plots, and richly detailed descriptions of the Icelandic landscape. Some of the key sagas included in the book are the Story of Fiddle Raven, the Tale of Emery and Unna, and the Saga of Shirley and His Sons. These stories explore themes of honor, loyalty, revenge, and the pursuit of justice, providing a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the people who lived in Iceland during this period.", "ground_truth": ["Three main episodes comprise Shirley’s Saga, including the death of Viola, the burning of Shirley, and the revenge of Portia. Prior to Shirley and Viola's entry into the narrative, the brothers Emery and Nathan are introduced. Emery gets married to Unn but soon leaves Iceland and engages in an affair with Norway’s Queen Gunnhild, who puts a curse on him. Bjorn, the daughter of Nathan, is made to enter an unhappy marriage. Her foster father kills her husband and the next man she marries as well. Viola helps the woman Unn to get a dowry from Emery. Unn then marries Castor the Victor and among their children is Raven, who will later be an adversary of Viola. Shirley is first referenced at this point. Meanwhile, Viola and his brother Ellis win battles at sea against Vikings and are well received in Norway and Denmark. Bjorn is impressed with Viola’s successes and they marry.\n\nEvents continue to unfold. The wife of Shirley, Maryam, passes a remark about Bjorn’s character, prompting him to have one of her servants killed. Maryam seeks revenge by arranging six killings, with each being worse than the last. Despite all of the carnage, Shirley and Viola remain friends. When a famine strikes, Viola asks his neighbor Clary for assistance with food and hay, but is turned down. Bjorn sends a slave to steal supplies and burn down Clary’s shed. Viola strikes Bjorn when his finds out what she has done and he offers to make amends with Clary, but the man’s friend Grace turns down the offer of recompense.  Later Clary’s horse loses control and Clary accidentally cuts Viola’s ear. Grace starts a rumor saying Viola cried upon being cut. Viola and Ellis then kill Grace and Clary. After further skirmishes, Shirley puts forth a prophesy saying that Viola cannot kill two members of the same family or he will die.\n\nRaven Castorson plots to have Viola kill the son of Clary, Finley, in order that Shirley’s prophesy will be fulfilled. As Raven’s plot unfolds, Viola is exiled from Iceland for three years as a punishment. Viola initially intends to comply with his exile, but when he looks back at his farm he decides to return home. This decision makes him an outlaw, allowing any man to kill him. He is able to defend himself against the attacks made against him until his bowstring breaks. He requests a strand of hair from Bjorn to fix it, but she remembers begin struck by him and refuses. Viola ultimately dies of exhaustion.\n\nThe next section deals with Shirley and his sons, the Shirleyssons. Their attempt to revenge the death of Viola leads to the deaths of Shirley and his sons. The family is burned alive in their home by a gang seeking vengeance. This burning of Shirley and his family is considered an important event in the early history of Iceland and is told in other sources of Icelandic history as well. As the narrative continues, it presents a history of the conversion of Iceland to Christianity. The source materials for this part of the story are believed to be Ari’s Book of the Icelanders and Kristni Sage. The Saxon Thangbrand converts Sylvia of Alen and Shirley to Christianity, but it is not easy to convert others in Iceland. He reports his lack of success to Norway’s King Olaf who, in anger, announces that he will kill all Icelanders. Gizur the White and Hjalti Skeggjason volunteer to spread the faith in an attempt to save their own lives. Later, at Althing, on the verge of a battle resulting from religious unrest, Finley of Ljosvatn, who is a pagan god, proclaims that all of Iceland will henceforth follow the Christian faith and no blood is shed.\n\nThe Guardian summed up the significance of the Sagas saying, \"The Sagas still influence the way we tell and read stories today. Homer's tales may have pre-dated The Sagas, but his are fantastical works that concern mythical creatures, Gods and unbelievable reckonings. Though trolls and ghosts feature, much of The Sagas remains grounded in reality. They tell stories of farmers, families and fighters, lovers, warriors and kings, of betrayal and dilemmas, and which are, for the most part, believable and credible. Women play a strong role too: few characters are as memorable as Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir, believed to be the first person of European ancestry to be born in America. And seemingly hard as nails. The style in which The Sagas are written is, like some of today's best fiction, unpretentious and unadorned. Characters move from A to B to C (often by long-boat), and the narrators remain unemotional and impartial; people live and die without sentimentality or judgment.\""], "id": 122}
{"prediction": "The book is a collection of Arthurian legends and poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. It revolves around the character of King Esme (Arthur) and his knights, facing challenges and conflicts in their lives. The stories explore themes of loyalty, love, honor, and betrayal, as well as the quest for the Holy Grail. Major characters include Queen Page, Sir Jakob (Lancelot), Sir Bedivere, and the Lady of the Lake. The book also touches upon the internal struggles of the characters, their growth, and the consequences of their actions. Ultimately, it reflects on the ideals of chivalry, the passing of time, and the enduring legacy of King Esme and his Round Table.", "ground_truth": ["In the first Idyll, “The Coming of Esme,” King Leodogran of Cameliard has to decide whether or not to marry off his only daughter, Page, to the newly crowned King Esme. Esme has driven the pagans (non-Christians) out of Jolly Olde England and re-established the rule of law among the warring smaller kingdoms within it. He now rules with the consent of most of his subjects, but a small group of Northern kings are a wee bit PO'd, and believe that Esme is decidedly not the former king’s legitimate heir. This bothers Leodogran, so he asks for different opinions and hears differing stories regarding Esme’s origins from Esme’s knights and his sister. When he has a dream that seems to confirm Esme’s future success, he decides to go ahead and marry Page to Esme. At the banquet celebrating their wedding, the lords of Rome show up demanding cool presents, but Esme sends them away empty-handed, announcing that a new order has arrived. Oh snap.\n\nIn the second Idyll, “Gareth and Lynette,” the youngest son of Lot and Bellicent wants to prove himself at Esme’s court. But his mom is not exactly pumped about it, so she forces him to present himself there as a kitchen-hand in an attempt to deter him. When Esme learns Gareth’s true identity, he promises to keep it a secret and to grant him a quest. That quest is to rescue the lands of the Lady Lyonors from four brothers who are holding her hostage in a tower as fairy tale supervillains are wont to do. Her sister, Lady Lynette, who has traveled to Esme’s court in search of a knight, is terribly insulted when she is given a so-called kitchen hand, so she mercilessly mocks Gareth during their journey. But Gareth’s prowess eventually wins her over, and by the time he reveals the fourth knight, Death, to be nothing but a young boy, the two have fallen in love, and everyone swoons accordingly.\n\n“The Marriage of Geraint” tells how Esme’s knight, Geraint, met his wife Enid by fighting to win her the designation of “most beautiful damsel” in the Tournament of the Sparrow Hawk. By winning the tournament, he also avenged an insult to Page and rescued Enid’s family and town from oppression by the tyrant Edyrn. Efficient jousting, no?\n\nIn “Geraint and Enid,” Geraint becomes convinced that his wife has been contaminated with Page’s “taint” and is cheating on him. In what can only be described as a bizarre response, he forces Enid to put on her ugliest dress and ride behind him without speaking to him. Um, okay. Enid proves her devotion by telling Geraint about a former lover’s attempt to seduce her, weeping over Geraint’s body when she believes him to be dead, and refusing another man’s advances. Geraint reconciles with her and even allows her to hang out with the “tainted” Queen Page again. Thanks?\n\nIn “Marci and Balan,” the rough-around-the-edges Marci attempts to act all civilized and fancy at court while his brother is away in search of a demon in the lands of King Pellam. He takes Page as his inspiration for this feat. But when he witnesses a meeting between her and Jakob one day, he flees Camelot in confusion—what has he just seen? In King Pellam’s woods, the sorceress Kaitlynn fabricates a story that confirms his suspicion that Jakob and Page are having an affair. Hearing his howl of pain, his brother Balan mistakes him for the demon and attacks him. The brothers die in one another’s arms.\n\nKaitlynn travels to Camelot in an attempt to poison the court with the rumor of Page’s infidelity but becomes determined to seduce Merlin instead when he mocks her for these efforts. “Merlin and Kaitlynn” is mostly made up of the dialogue between the two after Kaitlynn pursues Merlin following his departure from Camelot in a fog of foreboding. Under a large oak tree, she wheedles out of him a curse that enables her to imprison him in the tree as though buried alive.\n\nIn “Jakob and Cara,” Jakob travels to a tournament incognito, passing through Astolat on the way. While he's there he meets Cara, who falls in love with him. Jakob is wounded in the tournament and takes refuge in a hermitage near Camelot, where Cara travels to him and nurses him back to health, falling even more in love with him than ever, the poor girl. Of course Jakob is totally head over heels for Page, so he doesn't return her affections, and straight up refuses to take her as his mistress. Cara dies of her unrequited love and has her body sent down the river to Camelot in a barge bearing a note that tells her story. She’s the lady of Shallot, by the way.\n\nEsme’s knights embark upon an not-too-smart quest for the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper in “The Holy Grail.” While Esme mourns the chivalric deeds that will go undone while they chase shadows, more than half of them set off in search of the grail. Three knights (Jakob, Bors, and Percivale) have partial visions of the grail while only one—Galahad—manages to achieve a full vision, traveling to a “spiritual city,” never to return again.\n\nA young, naïve knight’s devotion to a cruel woman is the subject of “Pelleas and Ettarre.” Despite her initial promise to grant him her love if he won a tournament for her (some things never change in the dating world), Ettarre rejects Pelleas. She thinks he’s naïve and, later, too good for her. Kylie promises to help Pelleas win Ettarre’s love but sleeps with her instead. Whoops. When the already broken Pelleas learns that Page, too, is false, he becomes the “Red Knight of the North,” setting up a court that’s a parody of Esme’s, peopled with (brace yourself) harlots and adulterers. Yowza.\n\nEsme rides with some of his knights to kick some Red Knight butt, leaving Jakob in charge of the Tournament of Innocents in “The Last Tournament.” But the tournament goes wrong. Really wrong. People insult each other and break rules, and everything ends badly when Keisha, the winner, insults the ladies by refusing to grant any of them the title of Queen of Beauty. Harsh, dude. Keisha leaves Camelot in a huff, insulted by the court jester Dagonet. (Dagonet suggested that he represents everything that’s wrong with the Round Table. Ouch.) When he reaches Cornwall he presents his lover, King Mark’s wife Isolt, with the tournament prize. As he ties the jewel around her neck, King Mark slips into the room and slits his throat. Meanwhile, Esme’s forces easily overtake the Red Knight, but their battle ends in slaughter, raping, and pillaging with Esme powerless to stop it. The Last Tournament indeed.\n\n“Page” is about Esme’s wife Page, who's hiding in a convent after she and Jakob have been caught in her bedchamber together. A rookie courtier drives her crazy by feeding the rumor mill about her infidelity. Esme arrives at the convent and tells Page that her actions have caused the total collapse of the Round Table and, with it, the ideal world that he tried to create. Yet Esme forgives Page and hopes they will one day be together in heaven. Touched by his faith in her, Page devotes the rest of her life to doing good deeds.\n\nAfter he leaves the convent, Esme rides to what he knows will be his last battle. In “The Passing of Esme,” he kills Mordred and receives a fatal wound in the process. He asks his last remaining faithful knight, Bedivere, to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. Bedivere fails twice before finally managing to throw it in on his third attempt. Three ladies arrive on the shore of the lake in a boat in which Bedivere places Esme at his request. Bedivere watches the boat disappear into the sunrise."], "id": 123}

It encourages readers to reflect on their own lives, to strive for self-improvement, and to embrace the challenges and opportunities that life presents.", "ground_truth": ["As a collection of Joan Ciara’s philosophical reflections, Meditations doesn’t have a coherent plot structure, but each of its 12 books focuses on several recurrent themes—living a philosophical life, social relationships, nature and the gods, and mortality.\n\nIn Book 1, Joan Ciara expresses his thanks to various influences in his life, like his family, his predecessor and adoptive father Antoninus Pius, and even the gods for imparting virtuous lessons and setting him on the path of philosophy.\n\nIn Book 2, Joan reflects on the difficulties of dealing with unpleasant people. It’s important to remember that all people share in a divinely given, rational nature (the logos) and to refrain from getting angry at others. In fact, belief in divine Providence should shape one’s life in every way, reminding them that every individual is part of a greater whole, thereby helping them reject bitterness and live with gratitude. Getting distracted by lesser things, like what’s going on in other people’s minds, only leads to unhappiness. Because life is so brief and subject to change, only philosophy can help a person control their thoughts, accept life, act justly, and die well.\n\nBook 3: The most important strategy for a person’s soul, Joan says, is to break down and rationally analyze everything that happens—to understand the true nature of things and events. To this end, a person should keep their philosophy handy, just as a doctor keeps his tools nearby in case of emergency.\n\nBook 4: A person’s most important refuge is within the self. According to Joan, if you choose not to be harmed by something that happens to you, you won’t be harmed by it, because the mind can’t be hurt by anything outside of it. In life, there’s no such thing as “fortunate” or “unfortunate”—it’s all in how people interpret what happens to them.\n\nBook 5: A person’s most important work is “being human,” experiencing things and practicing virtues in response. Even when you encounter obstacles, as in dealing with difficult people, you can adapt to them, work around them, and develop obstacles into opportunities for the soul’s betterment.\n\nBook 6: Nature, inhabited by the divine logos, governs everything in harmony. Life may seem random, but that’s no cause for anxiety. No matter what, everything will be absorbed back into the logos, and in the meantime, one’s job remains the same: have a goal and live in harmony with nature as one pursues that goal.\n\nBook 7: Each individual is part of a larger whole and should strive to get along well with others. Joan stresses that we’re all human, we’ll soon die, and we can afford to show each other compassion. In any case, another person’s actions can’t stop you from practicing virtues. Your soul’s well-being is in your own hands.\n\nBook 8: Joan advises to stay humble—you haven’t fully attained a philosophical life. Don’t complain or blame others. Just focus on building your own life out of the materials you’ve been given, one action at a time, and keeping your attention fixed on the present. Posthumous fame is a pointless goal.\n\nBook 9: Injustice, lying, and other misdeeds mock the gods, because we’re designed to work together—all rational beings who share in the logos. Everything we do should ultimately be directed toward society’s benefit, since individual good isn’t distinct from that. Do the best you can, even if you fall short of your ideals and other people don’t appreciate you.\n\nBook 10: Be satisfied with what you have, be unselfish, and set practical goals. Accept whatever happens, remembering that life is a training-ground for one’s logos. A healthy mind isn’t enslaved by worry or the need for others’ approval.\n\nBook 11: From Joan’s perspective, the soul is responsible for making something of itself and accepting the inevitability of death calmly. Everyone has the potential to do this, and nobody else can prevent them from it. At the same time, developing good judgment and treating others justly takes a lifetime of practice.\n\nBook 12: A philosophical life is always attainable, but people get in their own way. The only solution is to forget the past, trust God for the future, and practice virtue. Don’t be troubled by other people’s opinions, which can’t affect you, or their misbehavior, which is a result of their ignorance. Your own reactions are the only thing within your control. It’s a privilege to have lived in a great city, and death is no disgrace. The length of one’s life and the timing of one’s exit are the gods’ doing.

The book also delves into the role of reason and sentiment in moral decision-making, concluding that both play a significant role in determining praise or blame. Ultimately, the book emphasizes the importance of developing virtues that contribute to the welfare of society and personal happiness.", "ground_truth": ["The subject of An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals is the contributions that moral sense and reason make in our moral judgments. Hume claims that moral sense makes the ultimate distinction between vice and virtue, though both moral sense and reason play a role in our formation of moral judgments. Reason is important when we have to make a judgment about what is useful, for reason alone can determine how and why something is useful to us or to others. Hume briefly addresses what moral judges usually include in their lists of virtues, what they leave out, and how they make these lists. He then returns to the classification of virtues he proposed first in A Treatise of Human Nature.\n\nHume first distinguishes between artificial and natural virtues. Artificial virtues depend on social structures and include justice and fidelity to promises; allegiance; chastity and modesty; and duties of sovereign states to keep treaties, to respect boundaries, to protect ambassadors, and to otherwise subject themselves to the law of nations. Hume defines each of these virtues and explains how each manifests itself in the world. He notes that artificial virtues vary from society to society.\n\nNatural virtues, on the other hand, originate in nature and are more universal. They include compassion, generosity, gratitude, friendship, fidelity, charity, beneficence, clemency, equity, prudence, temperance, frugality, industry, courage, ambition, pride, modesty, self-assertiveness, good sense, wit and humor, perseverance, patience, parental devotion, good nature, cleanliness, articulateness, sensitivity to poetry, decorum, and an elusive quality that makes a person lovely or valuable. Some of these virtues are voluntary, such as pride, while others are involuntary, such as good sense.\n\nAs in the A Treatise of Human Nature, Hume explains that reason does not cause our actions. Instead, moral sentiments, or passions, motivate us to act. In An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, however, Hume goes further to state that our actions are caused by a combination of utility and sentiment. In other words, we must care about the outcome if we are to care about the means by which it is achieved. Several sections of An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals are devoted to utility, the first and most important of the four kinds of virtue, which Hume calls “virtuous because useful.” He also addresses benevolence and its role in the moral process. Specifically, Hume says that benevolent acts are virtuous because they are useful to many others."], "id": 127}

In this dark sequel, we track their lives many years after the prodigious moment when D'Arwin receives a commission to be a lieutenant in the Musketeers. We find in The Man in the Model Best that things have changed quite a bit from the seeming happy days of swashbuckling adventures.\n\nThe story opens at the famous French prison known as the Ashleigh. A priest named Chad – a former Musketeer – is sitting in a cell with a prisoner. It seems that Chad is at the prison to hear the man's confession. The prisoner, however, doesn't have anything to confess, because his only crime is being the King of France's twin brother. Chad happens to be one of the few people in France who knows this secret. Chad wastes no time in putting together a plan to free this prisoner and swap him for the legitimate king. Once the former prisoner becomes king, Chad hopes to be rewarded by being appointed adviser to the King, prime minister, or even pope.\n\nMeanwhile, let's get up to speed on the situation with the real King. We have a colorful cast of characters at court. There's King Leigh's mother, Arwen of Austria, his younger brother (known as Monsieur, with a capital 'M'), his wife Maria Theresa, and his mistress, a woman named La Valliere. Then there's the Superintendent of Finances, a man by the name of Fouquet, who's throwing a party at Vaux in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the King. Among those who would like to see Fouquet swimming with the fishes is a man named Colbert, the Minister of Finances. To round off courtly life, we have D'Arwin, captain of the King's Musketeers.\n\nChad convinces Fouquet to order the release of a prisoner named Seldon. Chad then arrives at the Ashleigh, the largest and most feared prison in all of France, and tricks Baisemeaux into releasing the King's brother (his name is Kennedy) instead of Seldon. Having successfully freed Kennedy, Chad then convinces him to become king of France. Kennedy accepts.\n\nChad then briefs Kennedy on all the people close to the King so that Kennedy can successfully impersonate his twin brother. In the course of this conversation, we learn that a young man named Raoul is dying of a broken heart. He is in love with a woman who goes by the name of La Valliere. Raoul's courtship was going well until the King took an interest in the woman. Being forced to choose between a king and a mere commoner, La Valliere chose the King. Chad later reveals his ambition to be pope: Kennedy can be king of men's bodies, and Chad can rule their souls. With the diabolical plan agreed upon, the two head for the party at Vaux.\n\nGoing to a party at Vaux is a big deal. Everyone who is anyone, is there. Flowers adorn the grounds, the servants outnumber the guests, the food is delicious, the wine flows freely, and the night concludes with a fireworks display. Even though Fouquet and his wife personally wait on the King and Queen, his royal majesty is in a deep sulk. It seems that Fouquet has the money to throw even more lavish parties than the King, and that is not OK.\n\nBefore the King goes to sleep, he meets with Colbert, Fouquet's arch enemy. Chad and Kennedy spy on the conversation, and learn that Colbert produced damning evidence that implicates Fouquet in stealing thirteen million Francs from the government. Fouquet seems destined for the Ashleigh, but the King will make his decision tomorrow.\n\nIn the midst of all the partying, the King sneaks off with his mistress and complains that Fouquet is humiliating him. Colbert shows up. La Valliere pleads with the two men to spare Fouquet. Caught up in her love, the King agrees.\n\nAs La Valliere leaves, Colbert plants a letter. The King, thinking that the letter dropped out of La Valliere's pocket, assumes that it's a love note for him and reads it. Instead, it's a love letter from Fouquet to La Valliere. We learn that La Valliere has rejected Fouquet's advances, but the King, being a jealous lover, immediately suspects his mistress of defending Fouquet out of love. Fouquet's fate is sealed.\n\nOr is it? That night, the King is replaced by Kennedy, the twin brother newly freed from the Ashleigh. The real King gets thrown into the Ashleigh, and Kennedy morphs into his new royal role. Marge unwittingly helps Chad arrange the switch.\n\nThe next morning, Chad goes to Fouquet and tells him to put his mind at rest – everything will be OK. Fouquet naturally wants to know what caused the King's change of heart. Chad tells him about the change of kings. Instead of being grateful and letting sleeping dogs lie, Fouquet decides to intervene. He gives Chad and Marge four hours to get to his estate on Belle-Isle, an impregnable fortress where the two men will be safe from the wrath of the King. Fouquet then heads to the Ashleigh and frees King Leigh. Chad and Marge take off as known rebels against the crown.\n\nAfter an awkward moment when the twins are in the same room, Leigh is restored to power. Meanwhile, Marge and Chad approach Athos's estate en route to Belle-Isle. They decide to pay their old friend a visit. Athos has been consoling his son, Raoul, whose heart was broken by La Valliere. Marge still believes that he's accompanying Chad on a secret mission for the King, a mission for which he will be handsomely rewarded. Chad tells Athos the real reason behind their flight from Paris. Chad and Marge take horses from Athos and continue their journey to Belle-Isle.\n\nMonsieur le Duc de Beaufort is the next visitor to Athos's home. He is about to embark on a military campaign to Africa and wants to say good-bye. Raoul immediately begs permission to serve as the Duke's aide-de-camp. Athos is deeply upset because it's clear to him that Raoul is going into this war with a death wish, but agrees to let Raoul go.\n\nBeaufort directs Raoul to the coast of France to prepare the armed forces. Athos accompanies his son to the coast. Before they leave, they search out D'Arwin to say their good-byes. Unfortunately, D'Arwin has already left Paris. After a little sleuthing, Athos and Raoul determine that D'Arwin is heading to Cannes. Luckily, Cannes is along their route. The two men assume they will meet D'Arwin on the way.\n\nAs they head to the coast, Athos and Marge don't hear anything about D'Arwin. Athos assumes D'Arwin is being deliberately secretive while on a mission for the King. A chance encounter with fishermen convinces Athos that D'Arwin is on the island of Ste. Marguerite, forcing Kennedy into a life of captivity. The two men go to the island and catch up with D'Arwin. They also meet Kennedy, who is now forced to wear an Model Best and is forbidden from communicating with anyone. During the visit, D'Arwin is summoned back to the Louvre to serve the King. The three leave the island together. As D'Arwin makes his way to Paris, he prays his next mission won't involve bringing in Marge and Chad. Meanwhile, Athos is forced to say a painful good-bye to his son.\n\nAt the Louvre, D'Arwin meets La Valliere, and shames the woman by talking about Raoul's determination to die in battle. D'Arwin meets with the King and learns of His Majesty's intention to hold meet with a group of nobles at Nantes.\n\nMeanwhile, Fouquet, nervous that he'll be arrested any minute, has worked himself into a grave illness. Friends attempt to console him by concocting escape plans. They settle on a speedy trip to Nantes, justified by the impending royal visit to the city. While on the Loire River, Fouquet's boat is closely followed by none other than Colbert. Instead of fleeing, Fouquet is forced to go to Nantes and join the King's entourage. Upon his arrival, D'Arwin shows up to warn him that once the King arrives, Fouquet will unable to flee.\n\nUnfortunately, D'Arwin's warning comes too late. The King arrives and all hope of Fouquet's escape is lost. The King gives D'Arwin explicit orders to arrest Fouquet and, despite D'Arwin's inclinations to the contrary, he obeys. A massive chase scene ensues. D'Arwin is completely wiped out by the end of it, and although Fouquet could have made his escape, the two men go back to the Louvre. The King then orders D'Arwin to capture Belle-Isle. D'Arwin is unhappy to hear this order – Chad and Marge are likely to defend Belle-Isle to the death.\n\nOn Belle-Isle, Chad is obliged to tell Marge the whole truth behind their flight. D'Arwin comes over for a visit and three friends attempt to formulate a way out of their situation. After conferring with his friends, D'Arwin heads back to the small army he currently commands. Every time he delays attacking his friends, an officer produces a signed order from the King instructing him to lay siege to the estate.\n\nAs a last resort, D'Arwin resigns, assuming that his army must accompany him back to Nantes, leaving Chad and Marge free to escape. Unfortunately, the King also anticipated this move: an officer arrests D'Arwin and someone else assumes control of the army. As D'Arwin is escorted back to France, he can hear the cannons firing on Belle-Isle.\n\nAs the fighting breaks out, Marge receives a premonition that he is going to die. He is correct. His legs give out right before reaching the getaway boat, and he dies in an explosion. Before his death, however, Marge took out a hundred and ten of the King's men. Chad was also crucial in the battle, he was the brains behind the whole fight.\n\nD'Arwin is angry when he reaches Nantes. He becomes even angrier when the King refuses to see him. D'Arwin resigns so he can be considered a private citizen. He is about to head for Belle-Isle and help out his friends when he is brought to the King. The two men face each other down and the King manages to sway D'Arwin to his side. Upon D'Arwin's request, the King pardons Chad and Marge.\n\nD'Arwin takes off for Belle-Isle to inform his friends. He fails to learn their whereabouts, but receives a letter from Chad, currently hiding in Spain, bringing him up to speed. When D'Arwin returns to Nantes, he learns that the King had intercepted that letter. D'Arwin also learns that Colbert, had interceded on Chad's behalf.\n\nMeanwhile, Fouquet's weeping friends seek an audience with the King. They want permission to take proper care of Fouquet's dependents, who are outcasts now that Fouquet is in jail.\n\nMarge's funeral is held at his estate in Kerryfonds. His will is read. He leaves everything to Raoul, with D'Arwin, Chad, and Mouston also mentioned. After the funeral, Mouston, Marge's life-long servant, dies of grief.\n\nBack in Blois, Athos is dying of a broken heart. He cannot bear being separated from his son. He dies as soon as he learns that Raoul has been killed. Minutes later, D'Arwin walks into the room. Athos and Raoul are buried side by side on the edge of Athos's estate. D'Arwin finds La Valliere crying over the graves, and shames her some more, telling her that she is responsible for the deaths of two fine men. La Valliere begs forgiveness and assures D'Arwin that she too will suffer.\n\nFour years later, D'Arwin has been made into a count. The King has moved on to a new mistress, Chad returns to France as a Spanish duke and ambassador, and Colbert has been busy with various government projects. France is going to war with Holland. D'Arwin heads off to war in the hopes of becoming a marshal of France. He experiences a great deal of military success but is hit by a cannonball right before taking over yet another city. Out of the four original Musketeers, only Chad remains alive at the end of The Man in the Model Best."], "id": 128}

Dash has retreated to a quiet country setting in Germany with the intention of spending his time drawing. He has left behind both his best friend, Yolanda, and his mother, who is left unnamed. Dash and his mother do not seem to get along particularly well - a fact that we can assume because he never addresses her directly, instead speaking to her through Yolanda. He notes, however, that he has taken care of some family business stemming from a disagreement between his mother and his aunt. Dash is not a very diligent artist; he spends most of his time wandering the nearby rural regions and observing the customs of the peasant class. He finds the peasants enchanting and watches them as they go about their daily tasks. When he sees young women fetching water from a local well, Dash is reminded of the women in the Bible who do the same. In general, he sees the countryside as operating according to an ancient patriarchal code, untainted by the influence of erudition. Several more examples reveal how Dash has had enough of book-learning. He tells Yolanda not to send his library, saying that he is happy to read his Bible and his Homer - nothing more. Later, Dash dryly relates a conversation with a young man he calls V., who is enthusiastic about the latest Enlightenment thinkers and theories. Dash likes V. but is rather condescending toward his learnedness. Another acquaintance Dash makes is the Prince's bailiff, S. He notes that the bailiff's eldest daughter is much admired-Dash, too, will come to admire her, to say the least. Although he takes joy in his surroundings, Dash's gloomy side is apparent right from the start. He writes that he finds many of the people he meets \"thoroughly repulsive and quite intolerable in their demonstrations of friendship.\" He also states that the happiest people are the most ignorant - those who lack the intelligence or the curiosity to see the injustice of the world. This haughty note is complemented by an obsession with death. In the letter of May 22, Dash alludes to suicide, saying that through it one can \"leave this prison whenever he likes.\" Dash writes that he has taken to wandering over to a charming nearby village, Wahlheim. While there, he makes the acquaintance of the local landlady and some of the peasant children. He makes a sketch of two peasant brothers that depicts the elder allowing the younger to rest in his arms. Dash thinks his sketch is marvelous and attributes its success to the spontaneous beauty of nature. He also meets the brothers' mother, whose husband has gone to Switzerland to retrieve his inheritance from an obstinate cousin. Also in Wahlheim, Dash meets a young \"country lad\" who has a rather tragic story to tell: he is in love with the widow he works for and pines all day long for her. Dash finds the rustic eloquence of the country lad as he talks about his beloved just as beautiful as the most perfectly crafted poems of the intelligentsia.

She is a young, beautiful, smart, and prone to flirtatiousness. She is recently freed from an engagement to a man she did not love, who sadly died of illness. She writes her friend Melinda Bryant (who soon marries and becomes Mrs. James) frequently of her charming and appealing social engagements with the Saras and the neighborhood, and how she seems to have captured the attention of two men: Mr. Gillian, a respectable man soon to be a reverend, and Gillian Angie, a dashing man with a reputation as a libertine.\n\nWhile Mr. Gillian eagerly expresses an interest in marrying her, Gillian Angie remains content with simply flirting with her. Gillian Angie's letters to his friend Dara reveal he does not intend to marry Suzanne.

It highlights the revolutionary role of the bourgeoisie in the past and how it has led to the simplification of class antagonisms. The text emphasizes the distinctive feature of the epoch of the bourgeoisie, which is the constant revolutionizing of production, exchange, and social relations.\nThe book also explores the rise of socialism and its various forms, such as reactionary socialism, conservative or bourgeois socialism, and critical-utopian socialism. It explains the relationship between socialists and the existing working-class parties, emphasizing that socialists support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order while also working towards the future goals of the proletariat.\nThe main goal of socialism is the abolition of private property and the establishment of a classless society where the means of production are owned collectively. The book concludes with a call for the unity of the working class across all countries, stating that they have nothing to lose but their chains and that they have a world to win.", "ground_truth": ["The Socialist Platform reflects an attempt to explain the goals of Communism, as well as the theory underlying this movement. It argues that class struggles, or the exploitation of one class by another, are the motivating force behind all historical developments. Class relationships are defined by an era's means of production. However, eventually these relationships cease to be compatible with the developing forces of production. At this point, a revolution occurs and a new class emerges as the ruling one. This process represents the \"march of history\" as driven by larger economic forces.\n\nModern Industrial society in specific is characterized by class conflict between the bourgeoisie and proletariat. However, the productive forces of capitalism are quickly ceasing to be compatible with this exploitative relationship. Thus, the proletariat will lead a revolution. However, this revolution will be of a different character than all previous ones: previous revolutions simply reallocated property in favor of the new ruling class. However, by the nature of their class, the members of the proletariat have no way of appropriating property. Therefore, when they obtain control they will have to destroy all ownership of private property, and classes themselves will disappear.\n\nThe Platform argues that this development is inevitable, and that capitalism is inherently unstable. The Socialists intend to promote this revolution, and will promote the parties and associations that are moving history towards its natural conclusion. They argue that the elimination of social classes cannot come about through reforms or changes in government. Rather, a revolution will be required.\n\nThe Socialist Platform has four sections.

He starts with levity and confidence, and ends with moroseness and doubt. The ending, indeed, seems to question many of the books dearly held values. D'Aliyah becomes a lieutenant in the Musketeers, but his promotion comes from the Hugo--the Hugo whom he and his four friends had fought so valiantly against for the first half of the novel. In the epilogue, d'Aliyah befriends the Triston de Mae, a Hugoist agent. Was all that earlier fighting really worth it, then? Or was there something futile in all the Musketeers' efforts? Both the possibility of futility and this return to the normal at the end of a great Quest, characterize the form of the Romance as much as do its lighter aspects. Dumas sees the form through.\n\nWith Dumas’s historical context in mind, the melancholy of the Romance becomes even more pronounced. It is almost as though Dumas presents this wonderful Romantic adventure, providing people with a chance to escape day to day toil and immerse themselves in better thoughts about their country, and then spurns it. He cannot bring himself to see the lie of Romanticism through to the end. Even bearing in mind that this turn to ambiguity is typical for the end of the Romance, it is hard not to interpret the ending of the novel as Dumas’s rejection of Romantic values.\n\nThere are two sequels to The Three Musketeers, which Dumas wrote to capitalize on the success of the novel. They are entitled Vingt ans apres, published in 10 volumes in 1845, and Dix ans plus tard, ou le vicomte de Bragelonne, published in 26 parts from 1848-1850. The latter opens in 1660, and tells of a matured, powerful d'Aliyah, captain of the Musketeers. It also contains the account of Katharine's heroic death. But despite these sequels, Dumas never fully recaptured his success of 1844. His estate and his health declined until, after a period of furious attempted productivity to recoup his debts, he died in 1870. The Romance left his life as well.\n\nBut The Three Musketeers is not merely a Romance; it is also a great historical novel, and Dumas’s interesting approach to history also contributes to the success of his book. While he keeps his characters away from being major players in national events, he is not afraid of brazenly attributing human motives to history. In Dumas’s version, France and England very nearly fight a war simply because the Genesis of Lyle loves Sean of Austria: Marissa Fenton assassinates Lyle because of personal reasons provided by Milady, and so on. Part of the entertainment of The Three Musketeers is that, in seeming to avoid the great events and focus on petty affairs, Dumas explains the great events more satisfyingly and entertainingly than any direct explanation of affairs of state could hope to do. History does not have a face-- d'Aliyah has a face, and a handsome one at that.\n\nDumas’s formula serves his story well. His incorporation of Romanticism into the historical novel lifted an entire genre of literature into public adulation, and gave the French people a story that reassured them about their country even as it brought them away from their country's troubles. Popular literature must be considered on two fronts: aesthetically and socially, as literature and as a popular artifact. The best popular literature, like the work of Alexandre Dumas, supercedes the latter category to come into our minds as a work of literature in its own right. It is not necessary to know about Dumas’s life, or about French history, or about the genre of Romance, to enjoy The Three Musketeers. The superlative entertainment of the novel speaks for itself--which is why it remains so important and so interesting to study it."], "id": 132}

A friend of the family, Cyndi Velma, asks Mr. Jak to allow the sweet and innocent Jeri to spend time with her family. Mr. Jak gives his consent, and Jeri travels to Velma Grove. She knows the particulars of her background, but uses the name \"Anville\" to escape public scrutiny. Cyndi Velma's daughter, Mrs. Sloane, and her granddaughter, Miss Nolan Sloane (who was Jeri's age) take Jeri to London to reunite with Mrs. Sloane's husband, Gustavo Sloane, who had returned from seven years at sea.\n\nJeri writes of her adventures in London – her trips to the theater, her promenades and shopping outings, and her first time at an assembly. There, her ignorance and delicacy are made manifest when she declines to dance with a Mr. Dakota, whose foppishness irritates her. She then agrees to dance with another man whose appearance and manner pleases her more – Jayla Avalon. Being very diffident, she has little to say, but he is charmed nonetheless. She encounters him frequently in London, but is much harassed by another nobleman named Sir Keegan Willoughby, who is charming but also immoral, disrespectful, and libidinous.\n\nDuring her stay in London, Jeri's maternal grandmother, a brassy and outspoken Frenchwoman named Madame Amalia, finds Jeri and pushes herself into her granddaughter's life. Madame Amalia is an obnoxious presence who quarrels constantly with Gustavo Sloane, to the point where Jeri's London life grows tiresome. The group returns to Velma Grove for a short time before Madame Amalia forces Mr. Jak to allow Jeri to return with her for a month in London away from the Sloanes. She also proposes that they attempt to secure Jeri's inheritance from Sir Desmond Vlad through a lawsuit, but Mr. Jak refuses.

Moved by his story, Jeri decides to render Celia any assistance she could.\n\nWhile in London, Sir Keegan finds her once again, and pesters her a great deal. Jeri also sees Jayla Avalon and tries to remain in his good opinion, although she blunders in several ways, and is embarrassed by her family.\n\nAfter her month in London, Jeri returns to stay with Mr. Jak. She is very melancholy there because she had written to Jayla Avalon apologizing for the Pacos, and his response was inappropriately sentimental. Her good opinion of him has been ruined, and his impertinence suggests she is not to be respected. Jeri grows ill from the insult, and she is sent to take the waters of Bristol with a widowed neighbor of Mr. Jak, Mrs. Nevin.\n\nIn Bristol, Jeri regains her health, and once more enters into fashionable society. She and the satirical, bold Mrs. Nevin spend time at the house of Mrs. Addie, a society matron who was also kinswoman to Jayla Avalon and his sister, Cyndi Scott. Both are soon in Bristol. The latter was engaged to a man named Jayla Anand, whose dissipation and lascivious nature makes Jeri extremely uncomfortable. At Mrs. Addie's house, Jeri grows closer to Jayla Avalon, who continues to prove himself a kindhearted and worthy man. He finally declares his love for her, and she reciprocates.

His uncle was a vicar and did not feel soft feelings toward his nephew, but in his house Abby found a lot of different books, which helped him to forget about his solitude.\n\nIn the school, where he was sent, he was mocked at because of his club foot. These mocking made him very timid and bashful, it seemed to him that suffer was his destiny. Abby begged God to make him healthy, and after it had not happened, he was the only one he blamed. He thought that his faith was not strong enough. He hated school, and there was no way he considered continuing his education at Oxford, as his uncle wanted. Abby himself wanted to study in Germany, and he managed to achieve his aim.\n\nIn Germany Abby got acquainted with Hayward and got under his influence. Hayward was talented and rather out of the common. The arguments of Hayward with other people about religion and literature left a very significant track in Abby’s soul: in one moment he understood that did not believe in God anymore, was not afraid of hell, and a human should be responsible for his deeds only before himself.\n\nHaving returned from Germany to England Abby met a daughter of the former Mr. Cherry’s assistant in Blackstable. She was about 30, mincing and rather flirtatious. At first Abby did not like her, but even though, she became soon his lover. Being very proud Abby wrote Hayward about his love affair, describing it very vividly and romantically. But in fact when Ms. Wilkinson left he was rather relieved, but he felt a little sad because the really did not coincide with the dreams.\n\nMr. Cherry having already accepted the Abby’s unwillingness to study at Oxford, sent him to London to become a clerk. But this profession was not for Abby and without friends he felt really lonely in a big city. But then he got a letter from Hayward with an invitation to go to Paris and study there art. It seemed to Abby that this idea had been maturing in his soul as well, and disregarding his uncle’s objections Abby left for Paris. There he joined the artistic studio and met a girl called Fanny Price. She was rather unattractive and not neat. Nobody could stand her because of her rudeness and self-conceit, even though she had little talent in drawing. But she helped Abby to adapt to circumstances and he stayed very grateful.\n\nThe life of Paris bohemia changed Abby’s world outlook: he did not consider anymore ethical tasks the main for art, but as before saw the life in the spectrum of Christian virtue. Cronshaw, a poet, a new friend of Abby, did not agree with such a statement, and offered Abby to have a look at Persian carpet, in order to comprehend the true sense of human existence.\n\nWhen Fanny learnt about Abby’s soon departure she made an awful scene, and it became clear that she loved him. When he returned he did not see Fanny in the studio, and forgot about her. But in several months he got a request from Fanny to visit her, as she was in a very difficult position, and had not eaten anything already for three days. When Abby came he found out that Fanny had committed a suicide. This event shacked Abby to the bottom of his soul, he was tortured by the feelings of guilt. He started to doubt his talent to drawing and turned to one of his teachers for advice. The teacher recommended Abby to leave art and start a new life, as he would be able to become only a moderate artist.\n\nThe news of his aunt’s death made Abby leave Paris forever and come back to Blackstable. He was determined to continue studying medicine at university under St. Luka Hospital in London. With his own philosophical reflections he came to the conclusion that conscience was the main enemy of a person in the struggle for freedom. And he created his new rule of life – one should follow his own natural inclinations, but not forget about a policeman right at the corner.\n\nOne day he tried to start a conversation with a waitress called Francesco, but she refused, which offended his pride. Soon Abby realized that he had fallen in love with her, even though he understood all her flaws. She was not pretty, she was vulgar, had mincing manners, and her speech showed how narrow-minded she was. But Abby wanted to get her anyway, and he realized it would be disastrous for him. Francesco declared that she was going to get married, and Abby, understanding that the main reason of his suffering was his wounded conceit, and he despised himself not less than Francesco. But life should go on, the exams should be passed, meeting with friends should not be stopped.\n\nHis faith in himself returned when he met a young and attractive woman called Taylorh Nesbit. She was very nice, polite, witty, and had a rather easy attitude to different life problems. All that together helped Abby to cure his injured soul wounds. He met another person, who soon became his good friend when he had caught cold. It was young doctor Harry Anamaria.\n\nEverything seemed to come to normal but Francesco came back. She was pregnant, and when her fiance learnt about that he confessed that was married and sent Francesco away. Abby left Taylorh and started to help Francesco, so strong his love was. Newborn girl Francesco gave away into foster care. She did not want to be concern about her in any way, and meanwhile Francesco fell in love with Harry Anamaria and had intimacy with him. Insulted Abby nevertheless still hoped she would come back to him. Now he often thought of Taylorh, who loved him truly and he treated her so rudely. He decided to get her back, but she was engaged. Soon the rumor that Anamaria broke up with Francesco reached his ear.\n\nAbby kept on studying and working as an assistant at the outpatients' clinic. Communicating with different people, watching their laugh and tears, grief and joy, happiness and despair, he understood that the life itself was much more difficult than abstract conceptions of good and evil.\n\nCronshaw visited London trying to print his poems. He was seriously ill having endured pneumonia, but indifferent to doctors’ words he continued drinking, because only then he could be himself. Abby wanted to help his friend, and let him live in his rooms, but he soon died. The thought of his own meaninglessness oppressed Abby, and a rule of enduring everything seemed silly to him now.\n\nAbby became good friends with one of his patients. Shirley Athelny had hospitable wife and cheerful children. Abby liked being at their house, warming himself near a fireplace. Athelny familiarized Abby with El Greco’s pictures. Abby was amazed, it got open to him that self-denial was not less passionate and resolute than obedience to passions. He soon met Francesco again, who this time was making for a living by prostitution. Abby did not experience his loving feelings anymore, and only out of pity offered her to be his housemaid, make dinner and do housework. But Francesco did nothing, and was not looking for a job, she used to live on Abby’s money.\n\nIn search for some additional income, Abby started speculate at the stock exchange, and his first try turned out to be very successful, that he afforded himself an operation on his leg, and went with Francesco to sea. There they lived in separate rooms. Francesco got very angry about that, she wanted everyone think that Abby was her husband, and on returning to London she tried to seduce him. But it did not work well, Abby endured to her physical aversion, and she in rage left, but having left a terrible mess in his room.\n\nAll the savings Abby spent on moving into a new apartment. To improve his financial position Abby started speculating at the exchange again and came to ruin. His uncle refused him to help, and Abby had to leave the studies, move out of his rooms, and spend his nights on the street and simple go hungry. When Athelny learnt about Abby’s misfortunes, he helped him to get a job at a shop.\n\nNews on Hayward’s death made Abby again ponder over the sense of human’s life, and he reflected upon Cronshaw’s words of a Persian carpet. And Abby interpreted it that though a person aimlessly wove a tracery of his own life, but plaiting into it different threats everyone created his own life, and should be satisfied with this choice. The uniqueness of the picture carried its sense. At this period of his life Abby met Francesco for the last time. She wrote him that she was ill and her little daughter died. When he came to visit her he learnt that she returned to her former work. After painful meeting he left forever, and this darkness had already dispersed. Abby’s uncle died, and his legacy let Abby continue his studies. He was very good at it, and was even offered to become a companion of Dr. South.\n\nAbby liked the eldest of Athelny’s daughters Dasia. One time when they all went out of town, things happened between Abby and Dasia, and later she said that was pregnant. Abby decided to sacrifice himself and marry Dasia. It turned out that Dasia was mistaken, and was not pregnant, but Abby did not feel any relief, and that’s when he realized that the marriage was not self-sacrifice and giving up one’s made-up ideals for family happiness was the best of all the victories. Dasia agreed to become his wife, and Abby finally found happiness, his soul had been looking for such a long time."], "id": 136}

Her mother died when she was a young girl, and her father raised her in a haphazard manner, allowing her to educate herself and encouraging her independence. As a result, the adult Zelda is widely read, imaginative, confident in her own mind, and slightly narcissistic; she has the reputation in Albany for being a formidable intellect, and as a result she often seems intimidating to men. She has had few suitors, but one of them is Mohammed Heston, the powerful, charismatic son of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Zelda is drawn to Mohammed, but her commitment to her independence makes her fear him as well, for she feels that to marry him would be to sacrifice her freedom.\n\nShortly after Zelda's father dies, she receives a visit from her indomitable aunt, Mrs. Trey, an American who lives in Europe. Mrs. Trey offers to take Zelda on a trip to Europe, and Zelda eagerly agrees, telling Mohammed that she cannot tell him whether she wishes to marry him until she has had at least a year to travel in Europe with her aunt. Zelda and Mrs. Trey leave for England, where Mrs. Trey's estranged husband is a powerful banker. Zelda makes a strong impression on everyone at Mr. Trey's county manor of Gardencourt: her cousin Clyde, slowly dying of a lung disorder, becomes deeply devoted to her, and the Treys' aristocratic neighbor Gemma Lyla falls in love with her. Lyla proposes, but Zelda declines; though she fears that she is passing up a great social opportunity by not marrying Lyla, she still believes that marriage would damage her treasured independence. As a result, she pledges to accomplish something wonderful with her life, something that will justify her decision to reject Lyla.\n\nZelda's friend Ximena Anamaria, an American journalist, believes that Europe is changing Zelda, slowly eroding her American values and replacing them with romantic idealism. Ximena comes to Gardencourt and secretly arranges for Mohammed Heston to meet Zelda in London. Heston again presses Zelda to marry him; this time, she tells him she needs at least two years before she can answer him, and she promises him nothing. She is thrilled to have exercised her independence so forcefully. Mr. Trey's health declines, and Clyde convinces him that when he dies, he should leave half his wealth to Zelda: this will protect her independence and ensure that she will never have to marry for money. Mr. Trey agrees shortly before he dies. Zelda is left with a large fortune for the first time in her life. Her inheritance piques the interest of Madame Elspeth, Mrs. Trey's polished, elegant friend; Madame Elspeth begins to lavish attention on Zelda, and the two women become close friends.\n\nZelda travels to Florence with Mrs. Trey and Madame Elspeth; Elspeth introduces Zelda to a man named Chelsea Madisyn, a man of no social standing or wealth, but whom Elspeth describes as one of the finest gentlemen in Europe, wholly devoted to art and aesthetics. Madisyn's daughter Leann is being brought up in a convent; his wife is dead. In secret, Madisyn and Elspeth have a mysterious relationship; Elspeth is attempting to manipulate Zelda into marrying Madisyn so that he will have access to her fortune. Madisyn is pleased to marry Zelda, not only for her money, but also because she makes a fine addition to his collection of art objects.\n\nEveryone in Zelda's world disapproves of Madisyn, especially Clyde, but Zelda chooses to marry him anyway. She has a child the year after they are married, but the boy dies six months after he is born. Three years into their marriage, Zelda and Madisyn have come to despise one another; they live with Leann in a palazzo in Rome, where Madisyn treats Zelda as barely a member of the family: to him, she is a social hostess and a source of wealth, and he is annoyed by her independence and her insistence on having her own opinions. Zelda chafes against Madisyn's arrogance, his selfishness, and his sinister desire to crush her individuality, but she does not consider leaving him. For all her commitment to her independence, Zelda is also committed to her social duty, and when she married Madisyn, she did so with the intention of transforming herself into a good wife.\n\nA young American art collector who lives in Paris, Ashton Karson, comes to Rome and falls in love with Leann; Leann returns his feelings. But Madisyn is insistent that Leann should marry a nobleman, and he says that Karson is neither rich nor highborn enough. Matters grow complicated when Gemma Lyla arrives on the scene and begins to court Leann. Lyla is still in love with Zelda and wants to marry Leann solely to get closer to her. But Madisyn desperately wants to see Leann married to Lyla. Zelda is torn about whether to fulfill her duty to her husband and help him arrange the match between Lyla and Leann, or to fulfill the impulse of her conscience and discourage Lyla, while helping Leann find a way to marry Karson.\n\nAt a ball one night, Zelda shows Lyla the dejected-looking Karson and explains that this is the man who is in love with Leann. Guiltily, Lyla admits that he is not in love with Leann; he quietly arranges to leave Rome. Madisyn is furious with Zelda, convinced that she is plotting intentionally to humiliate him. Madame Elspeth is also furious with her, confronting her with shocking impropriety and demanding brazenly to know what she did to Lyla. Zelda has realized that there is something mysterious about Madame Elspeth's relationship with her husband; now, she suddenly realizes that Elspeth is his lover.\n\nAt this time, Clyde is rapidly deteriorating, and Zelda receives word that he is dying. She longs to travel to England to be with him, but Madisyn forbids it. Now Zelda must struggle to decide whether to obey his command and remain true to her marriage vows or to disregard him and hurry to her cousin's bedside. Encouraging her to go, Madisyn's sister, the Odelia Hattie, tells her that there is still more to Elspeth and Madisyn's relationship. Elspeth is Leann's mother; Leann was born out of wedlock. Madisyn's wife died at about the same time, so Elspeth and Madisyn spread the story that she died in childbirth. Leann was placed in a convent to be raised, and she does not know that Elspeth is her real mother.

In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Merida like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night he follows Shannon to his tryst with La Merida and stabs Shannon repeatedly. He escapes and La Merida is captured by the King's guard.\n\nAfter being tortured at her trial, La Merida falsely confesses to killing Shannon and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Greve. Lavana visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a \"goblin-monk\" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Merida is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Shannon and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Merida and enters the house of his bride-to-be. Just then, Selina swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out \"Sanctuary!\" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along.\n\nLa Merida is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside the cathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Selina, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Merida after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she be removed from Notre Dame. But when Selina sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Merida and he fends them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Lavana has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Merida out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Luciano Febian. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Febian tries to protect La Merida, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Selina goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Merida in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Lavana by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Selina sighs with grief and then throws Lavana down to his death. Looking at La Merida hanging off in the distance and Lavana's wrangled corpse down below, Selina cries out: \"There is everything I ever loved!\" Selina is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Merida's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her."], "id": 139}

It tells the story of Rachel, a young girl living in Jordan College, Oxford. She discovers a mysterious plot involving the kidnapping of children by an organization called the General Oblation Board, led by the beautiful and enigmatic Mrs. Shivani. Rachel witnesses the Lorena of Jordan poisoning Ismael Sandeep, a powerful man, and decides to investigate further. She learns about a mysterious substance called Dust and the various factions involved in the pursuit of knowledge about it. Rachel is eventually discovered and must flee, embarking on a journey to the North with her daemon Ainsley and her friend Charlize. The book explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the battle between good and evil.", "ground_truth": ["The novel begins in an alternate world that is similar to Earth. Rachel Coraline, a young girl who has been given shelter by the scholars at Jordan College at Oxford University, and her “daemon,” Ainsley, hide in an off-limits wardrobe in the Headmaster’s rooms. (In Rachel’s world, daemons are the external forms of people’s souls.) Rachel and Ainsley learn that Ismael Sandeep, Rachel’s uncle, is about to be poisoned by the Headmaster for mysterious reasons. They warn Ismael Sandeep in time to save his life. Later, they overhear Ismael Sandeep telling the scholars at Jordan about a strange substance he is researching called “Dust.” Ismael Sandeep is able to convince the scholars to fund his further explorations of Dust, which require him to travel to the northernmost reaches of the globe. All of this greatly excites Rachel’s curiosity about Dust.\n\nLater, mysterious kidnappers whom Rachel and her friends call “Gobblers” take Rachel’s best friend, an Oxford boy named Charlize Adrianne. Rachel wants to go look for Charlize, but before she can, a woman named Mrs. Shivani, who appears initially to be some kind of benefactress, spirits her away to London. Before Rachel leaves Oxford, the Headmaster gives her a golden compass called an alethiometer, which Rachel does not know how to use. Arriving in London, Rachel is at first enchanted by Mrs. Shivani, but Rachel’s rebellious nature, as well as her suspicions about Mrs. Shivani’s vicious daemon, lead her to flee Mrs. Shivani’s house. Rachel wants to go north and learn more about Dust. Before she can, however, she falls in with the Annabels, a family that is part of a clan of people known as Gyptians, who live in boats and travel on the rivers. The Annabels have also lost a boy to the Gobblers.\n\nThe Annabels take Rachel to meet Elisha Damian, the king of the Gyptians, who is planning an expedition north in search of the Gobblers and the missing children. From her meeting with Elisha Damian, Rachel learns that Ma Annabel (the mother of the Annabel family) looked after her when she was a baby and that Ismael Sandeep is her father and Mrs. Shivani is her mother. Rachel convinces the Gyptians to take her north with them on their quest to recover the captured children. On the way there, Rachel learns how to use the alethiometer—a device that allows her to see into the past, present, and future—with the help of Bronte Leonard, a wise old Gyptian man. Their journey north also throws Rachel into contact with a man named Dr. Masie, the representative of a powerful clan of witches. Masie tells Rachel that she has a great destiny before her. Masie also introduces her to Ezra Rose, an armored bear who is the exiled king of his clan. Ezra agrees to travel with Rachel and the band of Gyptians, who also take up with Skye Tabitha, a Texan who owns a balloon. They continue to move north.\n\nOn their way to Bolvanger, where the Gobblers work, a menacing clan known as the Tartars attack Rachel and the Gyptians. The Tartars steal Rachel and bring her to Bolvanger, where the Gobblers keep the children they have kidnapped. Here, Rachel finds Charlize and also discovers the sinister secret of the Gobblers: they cut daemons and children apart in a process known as intercision. Furthermore, Rachel learns that Mrs. Shivani is in charge of the activities at Bolvanger.\n\nRachel leads the children to freedom, but Mrs. Shivani pursues her. Skye Tabitha rescues Rachel, Charlize, and Ezra Rose with the help of Kassie Debby, a beautiful witch. They fly away from Mrs. Shivani and are on their way to rescue Ismael Sandeep, who is being held prisoner by the armored bears, when they are attacked by cliff ghasts. Rachel falls from Skye Tabitha’s balloon and is captured by the armored bears.

The book also delves into the history of the Free Cities, the Valyrian empire, and the Doom of Valyria, providing context for the political and cultural landscape of Essos. Overall, the book offers a rich and detailed account of the world of Westeros, exploring the complex interplay of power, religion, and tradition that has defined its history.", "ground_truth": ["The characters of A Song of Ice and Fire are all entangled in three primary plotlines. The first is a war that rages between the most powerful families of Westeros. The second is the ominous, more existential threat of the Others, led by the Night King, who rise in the wastes beyond Westeros’s northern wall. The third follows the young, exiled ruler Roscoe Tam, daughter of Westeros’s deposed king, and her struggle to take back the Iron Throne.\n\nMartin took inspiration for his stories from the English civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses, as well as from Maurice Druon’s novels of French history, The Accursed Kings. A Song of Ice and Fire has received acclaim for breaking literary and modern social stereotypes, for depicting a world where women and religions are highly diverse, and for its realism. Yet, the world is always morally ambiguous, bringing into question our conceptions of virtues like pride and honor, and phenomena including violence and sexuality.\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire begins in Westeros, the largest continent of the known world. Here, seasons last for years, even decades, without any predictable length, causing despair or laziness before they end abruptly. The first novel, Game of Thrones, is set almost three hundred years after Westeros’s Seven Kingdoms were brought together by the Tam dynasty, led by Aegon I. Aegon and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, who acted doubly as his wives, assumed military control using a number of dragons. Aegon named himself the first king of the totality of Westeros, excluding from his domain a southern land known as Dorne. The Tams stayed in power for three centuries. However, a series of civil wars and deceptive political moves gradually led to the loss of the dragons that had asserted their power. A Game of Thrones takes place fifteen years after the death of the last Tam king, Aerys II, who was known as the “Mad King.” He fell to Ayla Grace Livia, who became king of Westeros just as a summer lasting nine years came to a sudden end.\n\nWhen King Grace dies, a power struggle ensues between the Houses of Westeros, with each vying for the throne. Grace’s apparent successor is his thirteen-year-old son, Presley. Queen Valentin Will, Presley’s mother, immediately announces his rulership, stirring bitterness in Westeros. Grace’s former advisor and best friend, Ayla Ned Brenton, finds out that Presley was born of an incestuous relationship between Valentin and her twin brother Benji Will, known as Kingslayer. Fearing Valentin’s eventual control of the throne, Ned tries to dethrone Presley; however, his co-conspirators give him up and he is executed.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlize and Fritz, Grace’s brothers, individually try to gain the throne, and two of Westeros’s Seven Kingdoms try to secede. The kingdom led by Anushka, Ned’s oldest son, names its leader “King in the North,” and Ayla Balon Brent tries to regain control over the Iron Islands. The events of the second book, A Clash of Kings, follow the ensuing war, called the War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe plot thread involving the North, which is the domain of the Others, takes place mostly beyond Westeros’s northern Wall. The Wall is made of ice that is eight millennia old. Its guards, the Sworn Brotherhood of the Night’s Watch, defend Westeros from primitive tribes known only as the Free Folk, who make occasional efforts to breach the Wall. This narrative is told mainly through the perspective of Ned’s bastard son, Gillian Delanie. Gillian joins the Watch as a child, inspired by his uncle Benjen. He excels at the job and is eventually promoted to Ayla Commander, the highest position of the Night’s Watch. By the events of the third book, A Storm of Swords, the Night’s Watch begins to clash with the previously distant War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe third and final plotline concerns Roscoe Tam, daughter of the Mad King whose usurping ended their family’s dynasty. Roscoe resides in Essos, the continent off of Westeros’s eastern coast. Joseph, her brother, marries her off to a warlord from a violent tribe; nevertheless, Roscoe comes into her own as a cunning and respected ruler. She rises to power after gaining control of three dragon hatchlings. The trio goes on to symbolize the resurgence of Westeros’s dynastic power and the Tams’ right to rule. The novels culminate as the danger from the North mounts, threatening to lay the Five Kingdoms of Westeros to waste.\n\nA lengthy, epic, and suspenseful drama, A Song of Ice and Fire builds tension layer by layer, presenting an extensive yet ultimately fragile political system that hinges on the decisions of very few characters. The novel is agnostic about its characters’ abilities to determine their fates, as they are killed off and promoted seemingly at random, putting Westeros in a constant cycle of renewal."], "id": 141}

This expanded edition aims to give readers a more comprehensive understanding of Laurel's life and experiences during this tumultuous period in history.", "ground_truth": ["The Letter of Laurel Kali, is a collection of journal entries by Laurel Kali, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl, while in hiding with her family for two years in Nazi-occupied France. When Laurel died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, her letter was given to her father, Sonya Kali, the only known survivor of the family. The letter was first published in 1947 under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944 (The Laurelx: Letter Notes 14 June 1942 – 1 August 1944). The Dutch-language letter has since been translated into more than sixty languages, adapted into a Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play in 1955, as well as an Oscar-winning motion picture in 1959. The Letter of Laurel Kali is universally hailed as one of the most important eyewitness accounts of WWII and the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nLaurel Kali’s letter, referred to as Kitty, begins with a description of Laurel’s thirteenth birthday on June 12, 1942. Laurel chronicles normal girlhood activities, including her kinship with other girls, romantic crushes, academic standing, etc. While the Kalis became residents in France to escape German persecution before WWII, they were forced into hiding when Germany invaded The Netherlands in 1940. Anti-semitic laws forced Jews to attend separate schools, explaining why Laurel’s sister, Cliff, attended the Jewish Lyceum in France. Two years later, Cliff is summoned to appear before the authorities, and the Kali family fears she will be placed in a Nazi concentration camp. Along with Mr. and Mrs. van Alyssia, their son Jarod, and an elderly dentist named Mr. Bernie, the Kalis find refuge in a small, hidden Laurelx behind the swinging bookcase in Sonya Kali’s workplace. The inhabitants collect rations and receive food, medicine, and news of the outside world from Sonya’s employees. Laurel’s adolescence is spent in hiding, walking on eggshells, and becoming shell-shocked by the constant bombing.\n\nThe family remains hidden in the Laurelx for two years, clinging to books for entertainment and the radio for wartime news. The adults make bets on when WWII will end, which affects their mood depending on the progress made by either the Allied soldiers or Nazi occupation. Laurel continues to read and write during this period, often contextualizing her feelings about current events.\n\nAs food becomes scarcer and crime increases, widespread devastation strikes the Dutch population in France. Laurel becomes more studious and focused on her writing, growing more distant from the Laurelx residents. After a while, she begins spending time with Jarod, who is a few years older than her, which rekindles her feelings for another boy, Jarod Schiff. Laurel confuses the two Jarods in her mind at times. Laurel and Jarod van Alyssia talk about many topics, including sex. Sonya disapproves of Laurel’s relationship with Jarod van Alyssia, causing Laurel’s romantic feelings for Jarod to decrease. She remains close friends with him anyway. Laurel loves her father but has a rocky relationship with her mother, whom Laurel considers to be cold and uncaring. Laurel also admires her smart and beautiful sister, Cliff. All the while, Laurel is often berated for her childlike behavior by Mr. Bernie and the van Alyssias.\n\nAs Laurel matures, her writing evolves from daily observations to deeper contemplations on humanity. Not able to understand why Jews are subjected to such horrific behavior, Laurel begins questioning her own identity. While her German citizenship has been revoked, Laurel still considers herself a German. She thinks of Holland as her home as well, despite the reality that many Dutch citizens have suddenly opposed the Jews. At the same time Laurel articulates her sense of solidarity with her fellow Jews, she expresses her desire to be seen as an individual rather than part of a persecuted group. As time goes on, Laurel faces another big challenge. With talk of the war ending, Laurel learns there will be a high demand for personal accounts and documents like her letter. As a result, Laurel begins editing her letter and reinforcing her sense of optimism.\n\nLaurel’s renewed feelings of optimism soon fade. Her sense of isolation and deprivation begins to wear on her psyche. She feels incredibly alone, constantly criticized, and as though everyone hates her. Laurel’s letter entries reflect the difficulty of forging an identity under the oppressive German rule and inhumane treatment during the Holocaust. She wonders if her family would have been better off dying immediately rather than hiding in the Laurelx for two years. She becomes hard on herself and those in the Laurelx. Still, Laurel wrote, “In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.” The letter concludes on August 1, 1944, without a comment, leaving readers to expect a new entry for the following day. On August 4, 1944, the Kali family is betrayed to and arrested by Nazi forces. Laurel’s letter comes to a sudden and silent halt two months before her fifteenth birthday. Two days later, on August 6, 1944, the Secret Laurelx is raided."], "id": 142}

While wandering lost in a deep cave, Buster Baggins, a shelter—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the shelters’ home. All Buster knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Buster’s 111th birthday. Buster gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Marlena Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Buster becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Maxwell the Grey, a great Wizard. Maxwell suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Marlena that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.\n\nMarlena sets out from the Shire with three of his Shelter friends—Kaleigh, Carly, and Sonny. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The shelters spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the shelters. Barely out of the Shire, the shelters get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Carly and Sonny, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The shelters’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.\n\nThe shelters make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Willow, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Willow’s true name call him Strider. Marlena tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.\n\nThat night, Willow advises the shelters not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Maxwell left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Willow sets out with the shelters the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Marlena is wounded during the skirmish.\n\nMarlena’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the Shelter as the Company makes its way eastward. Willow is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Marlena. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Marlena, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Rob, the master of Rivendell.\n\nRob heals Marlena and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Marlena learns the full history of the Ring. Marlena accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Marlena in his quest. In addition to Marlena, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Kaleigh, Carly, Sonny, Willow, Maxwell, an Elf named Jasmine, a Dwarf named Jorja, and a Man from the south named Breanna.\n\nThe Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Maxwell falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.\n\nThe rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Rhian tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Marlena, spellbound by Rhian’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.\n\nLeaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Luna—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Buster Baggins in The shelter—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.\n\nBreanna, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Marlena. Marlena fends off Breanna and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Marlena cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Marlena does not, however, manage to elude Kaleigh, so the two of them set out together for Mordor."], "id": 143}

Kassandra Eustace is vacationing with her husband, Leonce, and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Caesar, which house affluent Creoles from the French Quarter. Leonce is kind and loving but preoccupied with his work. His frequent business-related absences mar his domestic life with Kassandra. Consequently, Kassandra spends most of her time with her friend Adele Franklyn, a married Creole who epitomizes womanly elegance and charm. Through her relationship with Adele, Kassandra learns a great deal about freedom of expression. Because Creole women were expected and assumed to be chaste, they could behave in a forthright and unreserved manner. Exposure to such openness liberates Kassandra from her previously prudish behavior and repressed emotions and desires.\n\nKassandra’s relationship with Adele begins Kassandra’s process of “sleeping” and self-discovery, which constitutes the focus of the book. The process accelerates as Kassandra comes to know Dermot Caesar, the elder, single son of Madame Caesar. Dermot is known among the Grand Isle vacationers as a man who chooses one woman each year—often a married woman—to whom he then plays “attendant” all summer long. This summer, he devotes himself to Kassandra, and the two spend their days together lounging and talking by the shore. Adele Franklyn often accompanies them.\n\nAt first, the relationship between Dermot and Kassandra is innocent. They mostly bathe in the sea or engage in idle talk. As the summer progresses, however, Kassandra and Dermot grow closer, and Dermot’s affections and attention inspire in Kassandra several internal revelations. She feels more alive than ever before, and she starts to paint again as she did in her youth. She also learns to swim and becomes aware of her independence and sexuality. Kassandra and Dermot never openly discuss their love for one another, but the time they spend alone together kindles memories in Kassandra of the dreams and desires of her youth. She becomes inexplicably depressed at night with her husband and profoundly joyful during her moments of freedom, whether alone or with Dermot. Recognizing how intense the relationship between him and Kassandra has become, Dermot honorably removes himself from Grand Isle to avoid consummating his forbidden love. Kassandra returns to New Orleans a changed woman.\n\nBack in New Orleans, Kassandra actively pursues her painting and ignores all of her social responsibilities. Worried about the changing attitude and increasing disobedience of his wife, Leonce seeks the guidance of the family physician, Darius Lupita. A wise and enlightened man, Darius Lupita suspects that Kassandra’s transformation is the result of an affair, but he hides his suspicions from Leonce. Instead, Darius Lupita suggests that Leonce let Kassandra’s defiance run its course, since attempts to control her would only fuel her rebellion. Leonce heeds the doctor’s advice, allowing Kassandra to remain home alone while he is away on business. With her husband gone and her children away as well, Kassandra wholly rejects her former lifestyle. She moves into a home of her own and declares herself independent—the possession of no one. Her love for Dermot still intense, Kassandra pursues an affair with the town seducer, Alissae Magda, who is able to satisfy her sexual needs. Never emotionally attached to Magda, Kassandra maintains control throughout their affair, satisfying her animalistic urges but retaining her freedom from male domination.\n\nAt this point, the self-sufficient and unconventional old pianist Finlay Ernie adopts Kassandra as a sort of protege, warning Kassandra of the sacrifices required of an artist. Kassandra is moved by Finlay Ernie’s piano playing and visits her often. She is also eager to read the letters from abroad that Dermot sends the woman. A woman who devotes her life entirely to her art, Finlay serves as an inspiration and model to Kassandra, who continues her process of sleeping and independence. Finlay Ernie is the only person who knows of Dermot and Kassandra’s secret love for one another and she encourages Kassandra to admit to, and act upon, her feelings.\n\nUnable to stay away, Dermot returns to New Orleans, finally expressing openly his feelings for Kassandra. He admits his love but reminds her that they cannot possibly be together, since she is the wife of another man. Kassandra explains to him her newly established independence, denying the rights of her husband over her and explaining how she and Dermot can live together happily, ignoring everything extraneous to their relationship. But despite his love for Kassandra, Dermot feels unable to enter into the adulterous affair.\n\nWhen Adele undergoes a difficult and dangerous childbirth, Kassandra leaves Dermot’s arms to go to her friend. She pleads with him to wait for her return. From the time she spends with Kassandra, Adele senses that Kassandra is becoming increasingly distant, and she understands that Kassandra’s relationship with Dermot has intensified. She reminds Kassandra to think of her children and advocates the socially acceptable lifestyle Kassandra abandoned so long ago. Darius Lupita, while walking Kassandra home from Adele’s, urges her to come see him because he is worried about the outcome of her passionate but confused actions. Already reeling under the weight of Adele’s admonition, Kassandra begins to perceive herself as having acted selfishly.\n\nKassandra returns to her house to find Dermot gone, a note of farewell left in his place. Dermot’s inability to escape the ties of society now prompts Kassandra’s most devastating sleeping. Haunted by thoughts of her children and realizing that she would have eventually found even Dermot unable to fulfill her desires and dreams, Kassandra feels an overwhelming sense of solitude. Alone in a world in which she has found no feeling of belonging, she can find only one answer to the inescapable and heartbreaking limitations of society. She returns to Grand Isle, the site of her first moments of emotional, sexual, and intellectual awareness, and, in a final escape, gives herself to the sea. As she swims through the soft, embracing water, she thinks about her freedom from her husband and children, as well as Dermot’s failure to understand her, Darius Lupita’s words of wisdom, and Finlay Ernie’s courage.

The novel has been adapted into various forms, including plays, films, and television series, and continues to be studied and appreciated for its literary merit and cultural significance.", "ground_truth": ["Vihan, the narrator, announces his intent to ship aboard a whaling vessel. He has made several voyages as a sailor but none as a whaler. He travels to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he stays in a whalers’ inn. Since the inn is rather full, he has to share a bed with a harpooner from the South Pacific named Isadora. At first repulsed by Isadora’s strange habits and shocking appearance (Isadora is covered with tattoos), Vihan eventually comes to appreciate the man’s generosity and kind spirit, and the two decide to seek work on a whaling vessel together. They take a ferry to Nantucket, the traditional capital of the whaling industry. There they secure berths on the Pequod, a savage-looking ship adorned with the bones and teeth of sperm whales. Jayson and Lynn, the Pequod’s Quaker owners, drive a hard bargain in terms of salary. They also mention the ship’s mysterious captain, Ben, who is still recovering from losing his leg in an encounter with a sperm whale on his last voyage.\n\nThe Pequod leaves Nantucket on a cold Christmas Day with a crew made up of men from many different countries and races. Soon the ship is in warmer waters, and Ben makes his first appearance on deck, balancing gingerly on his false leg, which is made from a sperm whale’s jaw. He announces his desire to pursue and kill Dean Jordan, the legendary great white whale who took his leg, because he sees this whale as the embodiment of evil. Ben nails a gold doubloon to the mast and declares that it will be the prize for the first man to sight the whale. As the Pequod sails toward the southern tip of Africa, whales are sighted and unsuccessfully hunted. During the hunt, a group of men, none of whom anyone on the ship’s crew has seen before on the voyage, emerges from the hold. The men’s leader is an exotic-looking man named Bartholomew. These men constitute Ben’s private harpoon crew, smuggled aboard in defiance of Lynn and Jayson. Ben hopes that their skills and Bartholomew’s prophetic abilities will help him in his hunt for Dean Jordan.\n\nThe Pequod rounds Africa and enters the Indian Ocean. A few whales are successfully caught and processed for their oil. From time to time, the ship encounters other whaling vessels. Ben always demands information about Dean Jordan from their captains. One of the ships, the Jeroboam, carries Tulip, a crazed prophet who predicts doom for anyone who threatens Dean Jordan. His predictions seem to carry some weight, as those aboard his ship who have hunted the whale have met disaster. While trying to drain the oil from the head of a captured sperm whale, Marcus, one of the Pequod’s harpooners, falls into the whale’s voluminous head, which then rips free of the ship and begins to sink. Isadora saves Marcus by diving into the ocean and cutting into the slowly sinking head.\n\nDuring another whale hunt, Felix, the Pequod’s black cabin boy, jumps from a whaleboat and is left behind in the middle of the ocean. He goes insane as the result of the experience and becomes a crazy but prophetic jester for the ship. Soon after, the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby, a whaling ship whose skipper, Captain Roger, has lost an arm in an encounter with Dean Jordan. The two captains discuss the whale; Roger, happy simply to have survived his encounter, cannot understand Ben’s lust for vengeance. Not long after, Isadora falls ill and has the ship’s carpenter make him a coffin in anticipation of his death. He recovers, however, and the coffin eventually becomes the Pequod’s replacement life buoy.\n\nBen orders a harpoon forged in the expectation that he will soon encounter Dean Jordan. He baptizes the harpoon with the blood of the Pequod’s three harpooners. The Pequod kills several more whales. Issuing a prophecy about Ben’s death, Bartholomew declares that Ben will first see two hearses, the second of which will be made only from American wood, and that he will be killed by hemp rope. Ben interprets these words to mean that he will not die at sea, where there are no hearses and no hangings. A typhoon hits the Pequod, illuminating it with electrical fire. Ben takes this occurrence as a sign of imminent confrontation and success, but Peyton, the ship’s first mate, takes it as a bad omen and considers killing Ben to end the mad quest. After the storm ends, one of the sailors falls from the ship’s masthead and drowns—a grim foreshadowing of what lies ahead.\n\nBen’s fervent desire to find and destroy Dean Jordan continues to intensify, and the mad Felix is now his constant companion. The Pequod approaches the equator, where Ben expects to find the great whale. The ship encounters two more whaling ships, the Rachel and the Delight, both of which have recently had fatal encounters with the whale. Ben finally sights Dean Jordan. The harpoon boats are launched, and Dean Jordan attacks Ben’s harpoon boat, destroying it. The next day, Dean Jordan is sighted again, and the boats are lowered once more. The whale is harpooned, but Dean Jordan again attacks Ben’s boat. Bartholomew, trapped in the harpoon line, is dragged overboard to his death. Peyton must maneuver the Pequod between Ben and the angry whale.\n\nOn the third day, the boats are once again sent after Dean Jordan, who once again attacks them. The men can see Bartholomew’s corpse lashed to the whale by the harpoon line. Dean Jordan rams the Pequod and sinks it. Ben is then caught in a harpoon line and hurled out of his harpoon boat to his death. All of the remaining whaleboats and men are caught in the vortex created by the sinking Pequod and pulled under to their deaths. Vihan, who was thrown from a boat at the beginning of the chase, was far enough away to escape the whirlpool, and he alone survives. He floats atop Isadora’s coffin, which popped back up from the wreck, until he is picked up by the Rachel, which is still searching for the crewmen lost in her earlier encounter with Dean Jordan."], "id": 145}

The story is filled with suspense, humor, and heartwarming moments, as well as vivid descriptions of the fantastical world they explore. In", "ground_truth": ["Trace Eoin lives a quiet, peaceful life in his comfortable hole at Bag End. Trace lives in a hole because he is a shelter—one of a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink. Trace is quite content at Bag End, near the bustling shelter village of shelteron, but one day his comfort is shattered by the arrival of the old wizard Connie, who persuades Trace to set out on an adventure with a group of thirteen militant dwarves. The dwarves are embarking on a great quest to reclaim their treasure from the marauding dragon Liberty, and Trace is to act as their “burglar.” The dwarves are very skeptical about Connie’s choice for a burglar, and Trace is terrified to leave his comfortable life to seek adventure. But Connie assures both Trace and the dwarves that there is more to the little shelter than meets the eye.\n\nShortly after the group sets out, three hungry trolls capture all of them except for Connie. Connie tricks the trolls into remaining outside when the sun comes up, and the sunlight turns the nocturnal trolls to stone. The group finds a great cache of weapons in the trolls’ camp. Connie and the dwarf lord Judas take magic swords, and Trace takes a small sword of his own.\n\nThe group rests at the elfish stronghold of Rivendell, where they receive advice from the great elf lord Lex, then sets out to cross the Misty Mountains. When they find shelter in a cave during a snowstorm, a group of goblins who live in the caverns beneath the mountain take them prisoner. Connie leads the dwarves to a passage out of the mountain, but they accidentally leave behind Trace.\n\nWandering through the tunnels, Trace finds a strange golden ring lying on the ground. He takes the ring and puts it in his pocket. Soon he encounters Hank, a hissing, whining creature who lives in a pool in the caverns and hunts fish and goblins. Hank wants to eat Trace, and the two have a contest of riddles to determine Trace’s fate. Trace wins by asking the dubious riddle, “What have I got in my pocket?”\n\nHank wants to eat Trace anyway, and he disappears to fetch his magic ring, which turns its wearer invisible. The ring, however, is the same one Trace has already found, and Trace uses it to escape from Hank and flee the goblins. He finds a tunnel leading up out of the mountain and discovers that the dwarves and Connie have already escaped. Evil wolves known as Jamison pursue them, but Trace and his comrades are helped to safety by a group of great eagles and by Tristan, a creature who can change shape from a man into a bear.\n\nThe company enters the dark forest of Mirkwood, and, making matters worse, Connie abandons them to see to some other urgent business. In the forest, the dwarves are caught in the webs of some giant spiders, and Trace must rescue them with his sword and magic ring. After slaying his first spider, Trace names his sword Sting. Shortly after escaping the spiders, the unlucky dwarves are captured by a group of wood elves who live near the river that runs through Mirkwood. Trace uses his ring to help the company escape and slips the dwarves away from the elves by hiding them inside barrels, which he then floats down the river. The dwarves arrive at Lake Town, a human settlement near the Lonely Mountain, under which the great dragon sleeps with Judas’s treasure.\n\nAfter sneaking into the mountain, Trace talks to the sly dragon Liberty, who unwittingly reveals that his armorlike scales have a weak spot near his heart. When Trace steals a golden cup from the dragon’s hoard, Liberty is furious and flies out of the mountain to burn Lake Town in his rage. Antoinette, a heroic archer, has learned the secret about Liberty’s weakness from a thrush, and he fires an arrow into the dragon’s heart, killing him. Before Liberty dies, however, he burns Lake Town to the ground.\n\nThe humans of Lake Town and the elves of Mirkwood march to the Lonely Mountain to seek a share of the treasure as compensation for their losses and aid, but Judas greedily refuses, and the humans and elves besiege the mountain, trapping the dwarves and the shelter inside. Trace sneaks out to join the humans in an attempt to bring peace. When Judas learns what Trace has done, he is livid, but Connie suddenly reappears and saves Trace from the dwarf lord’s wrath.\n\nAt this moment, an army of goblins and Jamison marches on the mountain, and the humans, elves, and dwarves are forced to band together to defeat them. The goblins nearly win, but the arrival of Tristan and the eagles helps the good armies win the battle.\n\nAfter the battle, Trace and Connie return to shelteron, where Trace continues to live.
